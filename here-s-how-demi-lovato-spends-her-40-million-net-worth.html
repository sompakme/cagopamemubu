It’s something that is very challenging."</p><p>Nonetheless, the time in the spotlight paid off in a different way, as Lovato was able to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rack in a $40 million net worth</a>, a number that will only grow moving forward.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Is Demi Lovato's Boyfriend, Jordan Lutes?</a></span></p><p>We’ll take a look at what else Lovato is spending her money on these days.</p><p><strong>Updated September 2023:</strong> Demi Lovato has been a part of the entertainment industry for decades.
