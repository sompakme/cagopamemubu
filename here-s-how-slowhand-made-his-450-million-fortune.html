From his early days as a guitar prodigy to his status as a rock and roll icon, Clapton's journey to financial success has been nothing short of extraordinary. Whether you're a die-hard fan or simply curious about the business of music, this is a must-read for anyone interested in learning about the financial successes of <a href=#>one of the greatest</a> musicians of all time.</p><h2 id=uncovering-the-early-life-and-times-of-eric-clapton>Uncovering the Early Life and Times of Eric Clapton</h2><p>Eric Clapton was born in 1945 in England to a teenage mother and a Canadian soldier who left the family shortly after Clapton's birth. Clapton was raised by his mother and her husband and did not learn the truth <a href=#>about his paternity</a> until later in life. He attended Hollyfield School in Surbiton and showed a natural talent for music and art. After leaving school, he worked as an apprentice cabinet maker before pursuing a career in music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clapton formed his first band in the early 1960s and went on to play with the Yardbirds, John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, and Cream. He has been married twice and has four children. Despite facing personal <a href=#>struggles including addiction</a> and loss, he has been able to weather every storm and keep pushing which has caused him to excel and have a successful and influential career in music.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>From Theater To NFTs: Here's How Seth Green Made His $40 Million Fortune</a></span></p><h2 id=breaking-through-in-the-industry>Breaking Through In The Industry&nbsp;</h2><p>Eric Clapton's career in music began in the early 1960s with his first band, the Roosters. Despite facing numerous challenges, including struggling to find steady gigs, Clapton's natural <a href=#>talent for the guitar</a> caught the attention of the Yardbirds and he joined the band as their lead guitarist. It was with the Yardbirds that Clapton gained his first taste of fame, and he went on to play with other popular bands such as John Mayall's Bluesbreakers and Cream.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During this early period of his career, Clapton released a number of successful albums and singles with the Yardbirds and Cream, including <i>For Your Love</i>, <i>I Feel Free</i>, and <i>Sunshine of Your Love</i>. These works helped establish Clapton as a force to be reckoned with <a href=#>in the music industry</a> and earned him a significant amount of money.</p><p>Despite being a relatively unknown musician at the start of his career, Clapton's passion for music and exceptional guitar skills quickly propelled him to the forefront of the rock and roll scene. His early success laid the foundation for a long and successful career that has made him one of the most influential musicians of all time.</p><h2 id=clapton-s-undying-thirst-for-success>Clapton’s Undying Thirst for Success</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After leaving the Bluesbreakers in mid-1996, Eric Clapton joined the supergroup Cream from 1966 to 1968. During his time in the band, he recorded several popular songs, including <i>Sunshine of Your Love</i>, <i>White Room</i>, and <i>Crossroads</i>. The group was financially successful and sold millions of records. However, tensions and <a href=#>drug and alcohol use</a> among the members led to the band's demise, causing Clapton to leave and pursue a solo career.</p><p>As soon as Clapton left Cream, he co-founded the group Blind Faith in 1969 with Ginger Baker, Steve Winwood, and Ric Grech. They released one successful album and went on a tour before disbanding.

He earned a significant amount of money for his work with Derek and the Dominos. In addition to his performance <a href=#>fees and record sales</a>, Clapton also received royalties for his songwriting contributions to the group's albums.&nbsp;The group ultimately ended due to personal and creative differences among the members and Clapton went on to have a successful solo career, while the other members of Derek and the Dominos went on to work on various other musical projects.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=raking-the-dough-in-more-than-one-way>Raking The Dough In More Than One Way</h2><p>Over the course of Eric Clapton's career, he has won numerous awards, including 18 Grammy Awards and the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music.&nbsp;In addition to his awards, Clapton has also had significant success in record sales.
