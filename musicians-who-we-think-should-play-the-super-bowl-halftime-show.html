Some of the most recognizable performers like Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Prince, Michael Jackson, and Madonna have graced the stage during the big night for football fanatics.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But, shockingly, there are many singers and bands that haven't played the show that we think would not only bring in massive numbers but would also give an incredible performance.</p><p>Here are eight musicians who we think should play the Superbowl halftime show.</p><h2 id=miley-cyrus-amp-dolly-parton><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Miley Cyrus & Dolly Parton</span></h2><p>Many are familiar with the connection Miley Cyrus and Dolly Parton have, as Parton is Cyrus's godmother and mentor, as well as recognize the star power the duo has together as they got to see the pair perform as hosts of the recent Miley's New Year's Eve Party.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We'd love to see either singer have an entire halftime spot, but seeing them perform together would further showcase their magic as a duo. With Dolly's iconic songs like "Jolene" and Miley's spunk with songs like her newest entry "Flowers," the show would have something for all ages and would be a nice balance between classy and wild, making the viewers in the stands and at home wonder just what will happen when they grace the stage together.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#> 20 Little Known Facts About Dolly Parton And Miley Cyrus' Relationship</a></span></p><h2 id=harry-styles><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Harry Styles</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Harry-Styles-posinfg.png><p>With newer acts getting halftime shows, we can't believe Harry Styles, or even One Direction, has never taken the prime slot at the Super Bowl. As one of the most in demand and raved about performers with a legion of fans right now, Styles would be a perfect choice for not just numbers to skyrocket, but for a great show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Styles provides an ode to the classics of the 70s with some of his most popular tunes while also keeping things fresh with his electrifying charisma on stage in <a href=#>sparkly outfits</a> and audience interactions. He's a natural-born performer that you can't help fall in love with.</p><h2 id=jonas-brothers><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Jonas Brothers</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/JonasBrothersHammered.jpg><p>The Jonas Brothers were once one of the biggest bands in the world and even after a lengthy breakup <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they returned to that label</a>, showing the dedication of their fans and the talent the three brothers possess. The Jonas Brothers is another example, similar to Harry Styles, that makes us scratch ours heads in confusion as to why they've never obtained the halftime slot. They've performed for other events, like the Cowboys 2022 Thanksgiving Day halftime show, proving they are more than capable of taking on the job.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With explosive songs that will have you jumping off your couch like "Sucker" and "Burnin' Up," the Brothers know how to make the audience feel like it's a good time. They could even perform their often overlooked song "Pom Poms," which would be a perfect anthem for the Super Bowl.</p><h2 id=elton-john><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Elton John</span></h2><p>While this legend has already wrapped the North American leg of his Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour, we'd love to see Elton John make a return exception for the halftime show. As a legend of music, it's implausible that John has never graced the stage at the Super Bowl.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While they've raked in the praise, many of the halftime's performers in recent years have been of the younger crowd, but John appeals to all ages with his magnificent hits like "Rocket Man" and "Tiny Dancer." We could also see some of <a href=#>his most famous collaborations</a> take center stage with him, like Lady Gaga and Eminem - artists who have both performed at the halftime show.</p><h2 id=cher><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Cher</span></h2><p>The "Goddess of Pop" may have sung the US National Anthem back in 1999 at Super Bowl XXXIII, but Cher deserves so much more - her own halftime spot. As a legend of both the screen and the stage, she's another example of an icon that surprisingly has never performed the halftime show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With dance-pop anthems like "Believe" and "If I Could Turn Back Time" she would have every audience member on their feet, like always. And even in her seventies, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cher has proven she is still as lively and dazzling as ever</a>, performing her seventh tour, Here We Go Again Tour, just a few short years ago.</p><h2 id=p-nk><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>P!NK</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pink_AEM-77.jpg><p>After seeing Lady Gaga's halftime show in 2017 where she launched herself down the arena and swung around on a pair of wires, we couldn't help but think about what singer P!nk could do with her signature aerials and acrobatics if given the chance. Not only does this powerhouse performer have an incredible lineup of songs that could bring the heat like "So What," "Get the Party Started" and "Just Like Fire," but she'd give us a halftime show like we've never seen with her gravity defining stunts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The show could also provide collaborative moments with the return to the stage for singer Nate Ruess to do a duet of the ballad "Just Give Me a Reason" or a woman empowerment moment with the Moulin Rouge! hit, "Lady Marmalade," with Christina Aguilera, Lil' Kim, and Mýa.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Pink's Life Is Like As A Mother And Wife</a></span></p><h2 id=pitbull><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Pitbull</span></h2><p>When <a href=#>Super Bowl LIV halftime show</a> was co-headlined by Jennifer Lopez and Shakira, many thought Pitbull would join them on stage in celebrating Latino culture and singing songs with both artists like "On the Floor," but Pitbull was largely absent from the night - only performing at the NFL Tailgate Tropicale concert to kick the night off.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, we think that Pitbull deserves his own halftime show, with mega stadium hits that will get the crowd excited and dancing, like "Timber," "Fireball," "Feel This Moment," and so many more. Pitbull's songs were meant for a fiery stadium show and fans are rallying for Mr. 305 to bring the heat to an upcoming halftime show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Things We Bet You Didn't Already Know About The Kiss Frontman Gene Simmons</a></span></p><h2 id=kiss><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Kiss</span></h2><p>Another iconic band with a current<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> farewell tour</a>, dubbed the End of the Road World Tour, we'd love to see Kiss add one more performance before bowing out - the Super Bowl halftime show. Like Pitbull, the hard rock band has performed a pre-game show, back in 1999, but have never been given the primetime slot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With their extreme stage antics complete with platform boots and fireworks with makeup engraved into the minds of those around the world, Kiss is a no-brainer when it comes to choosing a halftime show performer - or so one would think. They're the perfect loud and wild band to "Rock and Roll All Nite" with football's biggest event.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikrquZmLaiutJmrqGnXayybsDHoqWkZaOdvLa4w2anpZmpYsGpsYysrKmdomKvsMPLZp%2BapJaptq6xjKyfqK9f</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./nick-kroll-marries-pregnant-girlfriend-lily-kwong.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nick Kroll Marries Pregnant Girlfriend Lily Kwong">&larr;
