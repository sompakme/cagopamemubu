Here’s everything to know about his married life.</strong></p><p>TV personality Erik had made the headlines after appearing in&nbsp;Tiger King. Reportedly, he used to work as a zookeeper for&nbsp;Joe Exotic.</p><p>Furthermore, he also appeared in the documentary called&nbsp;Ghost Adventures. Later, he changed his career to cooking and worked at&nbsp;Michael’s Grill&nbsp;in Oklahoma.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="Erik Cowie Wife: Was He Married?">Erik Cowie Wife: Was He Married?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="Obituary: How Did The Tiger King Erik Cowie Die?">Obituary: How Did The Tiger King Erik Cowie Die?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3" href=# title="Erik Cowie Wikipedia Explored">Erik Cowie Wikipedia Explored</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-4" href=# title="Zookeeper Erik Net Worth: Was He Rich?">Zookeeper Erik Net Worth: Was He Rich?</a></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=erik-cowie-wife-was-he-married></span>Erik Cowie Wife: Was He Married?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The details of Erik Cowie’s wife are under review. Reportedly, he never spoke about his married life.</p><p>Multiple reports are optimistic about Erik’s love life. Some local sites claim that he was certainly married but didn’t reveal her name.</p><p>However, no official information has been provided online yet. Most probably, his family will speak once they find the right opportunity to do so.</p><p>Well, we believe that Cowie was a man who believed in keeping his personal life away from his professional life. Thus, he never spoke about his children too.</p><p>All we can say is that he was an animal lover. Reportedly, he stopped working as a zookeeper after Joe was arrested for murdering Carole Baskin, an animal rights activist.</p><p>According to&nbsp;The Sun, Erik had testified against Joe at a court trial. Well, he was aware of how his former boss used to execute several zoo animals.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=obituary-how-did-the-tiger-king-erik-cowie-die></span>Obituary: How Did The Tiger King Erik Cowie Die?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tiger King star Erik Cowie’s obituary is available online. Reportedly, his death was reported by one of his close friends.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Daily Mail, the police had discovered his body on September 3, 2021. Reportedly, there was nothing suspicious about his death.</p><p>So, we are still unable to figure how Erik died. Reportedly, no drugs were discovered at the scene. Nevertheless, a toxicology test will be conducted which will reveal the cause of his death.</p><p>Furthermore, his body was facing down in a bed inside a residence in New York City. However, we have no clue if the apartment belonged to the deceased.</p><p>Our entire team mourns for Erik’s demise. Also, we send our deepest condolences to his family and close friends.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=erik-cowie-wikipedia-explored></span>Erik Cowie Wikipedia Explored<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Erik Cowie’s biography is not present on Wikipedia. Nevertheless, we can find more about him on&nbsp;IMDb.</p><p>Well, multiple local sites claim that he didn’t have social media. So, there are only a few details about Erik on the internet.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=zookeeper-erik-net-worth-was-he-rich></span>Zookeeper Erik Net Worth: Was He Rich?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Erik Cowie didn’t reveal his net worth before he passed away.
