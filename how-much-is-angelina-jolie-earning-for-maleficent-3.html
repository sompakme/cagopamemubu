Given her credentials, having starred in over a dozen of successful blockbuster flicks, such as Tom Raider, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Wanted, and Salt, it's no surprise that the mother-of-six is one of the highest-paid stars in Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But when Jolie <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">signed on to star as Maleficent</a> in the self-titled 2014 movie, the 46-year-old ex-wife to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad Pitt</a>, earned her biggest paycheck to date, after Disney was said to have paid her an eye-watering $33 million, not including backend profits based on the film’s success at the box office.</p><p>The flick went on to gross over $750 million worldwide and included a second installment, titled Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, which hit cinemas in 2019. Given that she was not only brought back to reprise the role but was also credited as a producer on both movies, there’s no denying that Jolie made a fortune from both projects, though her payment for the second film was never disclosed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-will-angelina-make-for-lsquo-maleficent-3-rsquo>How Much Will Angelina Make For ‘Maleficent 3’?</h2><p>In September 2021, it was reported that Jolie had signed on to return to the Disney live-action franchise with a third film, particularly since its predecessors were incredibly successful, despite Mistress of Evil making $200 million less than from what the self-titled film generated in 2014.</p><p>While Disney has yet to confirm that Maleficent 3 is actually in the works, fans have noticed that the movie title appears under Jolie’s line-up of upcoming movies, with the film’s status being marked as “announced.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Biggest Film And TV Projects Angelina Jolie's Ex-Boyfriend Anton Schneider Worked On</a></span></p><p>There hasn’t been an official word from Disney confirming that a third movie is in the works, but IMDb surely wouldn’t have listed the title under Jolie’s official page if she hadn’t already signed on the dotted line.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Considering how much Jolie made for the first flick, it’s fair to assume she could probably make anywhere between $40m-$50m when adding any backend profits, her base pay for the role, and any other positions she carries behind the scenes, such as a producer position, which she also had on the previous two films.</p><p>According to popular movie site Giant Freakin Robot, who claimed to have scooped an exclusive, Jolie is already signed up to the upcoming project, which is expected to head into development later this year.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Fans Are Comparing Megan Fox And MGK To Angelina Jolie And Billy Bob Thornton</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Considering that the plot and storyline are still being pieced together, it’s unclear how much Jolie will be making from the motion picture, but it certainly won’t be any less than what she reportedly made when she first played Maleficent in 2014.</p><p>Per the publication, “One of our <a href=#>trusted and proven</a> inside sources has now learned that Disney is actively developing Maleficent 3. We can expect to see Angelina Jolie on screen as the infamous villain again soon, though from what we’ve learned, it doesn’t sound like the studio has a firm timeline yet.</p><p>“Considering that they are now developing the project, and there was a five-year gap between the first and second films, it may not be until 2024 or even 2025 that we see the third film release.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Still, fans can take comfort that the movie is actually happening, after nearly a two-year wait for news on the follow-up movie.”</p><h2 id=angelina-jolie-loves-playing-the-character>Angelina Jolie Loves Playing The Character</h2><p>In 2019, Jolie gushed about her love for Maleficent, saying that she relates to the misunderstood antagonist, who first appeared in the 16th animated feature film Sleeping Beauty in 1959.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kristen Stewart Once Said Jennifer Aniston Was Only Popular "Because Of Angelina Jolie"</a></span></p><p>Speaking to Variety about some of the qualities she has in common with the character, she expressed that the movies “remind me and I hope others that there’s a part of us that is just unbridled.”</p><p>“We just have to be who we are. We can’t be less than what we are. We can’t be less honest. We can’t be less fierce. We have to find ourselves and be free with it and be okay with it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She continued: “Being a mother brought out something in me that completely transformed me, similar to Maleficent. I felt a responsibility to be a better person. Maleficent is trying her best.</p><p>“I think where she fails is that she doesn’t believe in herself. She questions herself if she’s good enough to be a mother. I had questions when I first became a mother and whether I was fit or not. That struck a chord with me.”</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Angelina Jolie Never Appeared On David Letterman's 'Late Show' Again After This Awkward Interview</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYp5%2BVobavrYyjpqWhlWK6orjEn6CcnZ6penR50pqjmqqpZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./john-ducey-s-plastic-surgery-why-does-the-i-believe-in-santa-cast-s-face-look-so-smooth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="John Duceys Plastic Surgery: Why Does The I Believe in Santa Casts Face Look So Smooth?">&larr;
