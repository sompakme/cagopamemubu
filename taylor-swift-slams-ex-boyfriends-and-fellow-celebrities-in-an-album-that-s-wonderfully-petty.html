There's no doubt that her<a href=#> music </a>has resonated with millions and millions of fans worldwide. So much so that they endlessly dig into the true meaning of <a href=#>her most popular songs</a>. And usually, these lyrics reference one of<a href=#> her many famous ex-boyfriends</a>, such as <a href=#><strong>Joe Alwyn</strong></a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In her latest album,<strong> Swift absolutely rips apart numerous ex-boyfriends as well as other celebrities</strong>. This article will delve into which songs were about Matt Healy and Joe Swlyn. Then we will discuss the Jake Gyllenhaal and John Mayer references in "Tortured Poets Department". Finally, we will touch upon what Swift said about the Kardashian/Jenner family in her new work.</p><h2 id=quot-the-tortured-poets-department-quot-has-songs-about-taylor-swift-39-s-relationship-with-joe-alwyn-and-matt-healy>"The Tortured Poets Department" Has Songs About Taylor Swift's Relationship With Joe Alwyn And Matt Healy</h2><p>What surprised Taylor Swift fans was the inclusion of songs seemingly about her current boyfriend, Travis Kelce. What didn't surprise fans was the sheer amount of <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">songs allegedly about her ex-boyfriend</a> of six years, Joe Alwyn</strong>, and her<strong> controversial situationship with 1975 frontman, Matt Healy</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the big hit single from "Tortured Poets Department", "Fortnight", is certainly about an ex-boyfriend, it is inconclusive as to whether it's about Alwyn or Healy. The titular track on the album, however, is almost definite about Healy. The reference in the lyrics to a tattooed smoker is kind of a dead giveaway, according to Vulture. There's no doubt that <strong>Matt Healy is the 'tortured poet' of which Swift speaks</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1-34.jpg><p>"My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys" is certainly about Alwyn but also has a hint of Alwyn, according to Vulture. Same with "Down Bad". Then there's "So Long London", which is about the breakup between her and Joe Alwyn.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/why-joe-alwyn-s-mysterious-parents-were-almost-never-spotted-anywhere-near-taylor-swift-front-back-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Fans Believe Taylor Swift Revealed She Was In Denial About Her Joe Alwyn Relationship Ahead Of Her New Album's Release">Fans Believe Taylor Swift Revealed She Was In Denial About Her Joe Alwyn Relationship Ahead Of Her New Album's Release</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift may have hinted at being in denial about her relationship with Joe Alwyn ahead of the release of her 11th album.</p><p>According to Vulture, <strong>"Guilty As Sin" is about Swift feeling bad about fantasizing about Matt Healy</strong> while she was still with Alwyn. And "I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can)" is almost certainly about Healy. Not only because the lyrics of the song suggest a controversial and complicated artist, but the structure of the tile of the song is reminiscent of Healy's band, The 1975. Same goes for "The Albatross" which is a pretty insulting symbol to connect to Healy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/aylor-swift-and-matty-healy-s-midnights-songs-were-never-released-front-back-_-commons-licenses.jpg><p>While Healy certainly is featured the most in Taylor Swift's new album. Her big "loml" is featured prominently as well. Other "Tortured Poets Department" Songs About Joe Alwyn include:</p><ul><li>"How Did It End?"</li><li>"loml"</li><li>"The Black Dog"</li><li>"I Can Do It With A Broken Heart"</li><li>"I Hate It Here"</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ttweb_all-the-taylor-swift-songs-joe-alwyn-co-wrote-and-how-much-money-he-s-still-making-off-of-them_bk_a1_v2.jpg><p>Perhaps the song from Swift's 11th album that's getting the most press is "The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived". According to The Daily Mail, the track is a huge diss to Matt Healy. And this is so obvious that Healy's family friend responded, saying:</p><p>"He will not be surprised by the song.

Specifically, they believe that <strong>"The Manuscript" is about her short time with Mayer</strong>.

This would be on her "Midnights" album. Specifically, the song, "Would've, Could've, Should've".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/th-image-template-1.jpg><p>Among the 15 bonus tracks dropped hours after the initial release of "The Tortured Poets Department", is "The Manuscript". While some Swifites believe the song is about John Mayer, due to the age gap between him and Taylor Swift, others believe it's actually about Jake Gyllenhaal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:23</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/32322323322323223232232223.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Inside Taylor Swift's Relationships With Post Malone And Florence Welch Before Their 'Tortured Poets' Collabs">Inside Taylor Swift's Relationships With Post Malone And Florence Welch Before Their 'Tortured Poets' Collabs</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift fans are curious if she was friends with Post Malone and Florence Welch before collaborating on their epic songs for "Tortured Poets."</p><p>However, the song could very well be about both of them. Having said that, fans believe the lyric about "the professor" alludes specifically to Gyllenhaal, who was the focus of Swift's hit, "All Too Well". It's <strong>a lyric about a "professor" in "All Too Well" that has caused fans to believe that "The Manuscript" is about Jake Gyllenhaal</strong>, according to The Daily Mail.</p><h2 id=what-did-taylor-swift-write-about-kim-kardashian-in-quot-the-tortured-poets-department-quot>What Did Taylor Swift Write About Kim Kardashian In "The Tortured Poets Department"?</h2><p>While Taylor Swift exposed a lot about herself in her 11th studio album, "The Tortured Poets Department", including how she is a "functioning alcoholic", fans are sure she took numerous shots at a ton of famous people. While her ex-boyfriends were clearly the subject of many of the album songs, a lot of <strong>Swifties believe Swift took a shot at <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a></strong>, reigniting their feud.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/screenshot-2024-03-30-at-12-29-07-pm.png><p>According to The Daily Mail, <strong>Taylor Swift's "thanK you alMee" is about the Skims mogul and reality star.</strong> Part of this is due to the fact that "KIM' is spelled out in the oddly undercapitalized song title. The song, of course, isn't just about Kardashian as her ex-husband Kanye West also factors into the equation. The song discusses a feud Swift had with a girl named "Aimee" from her hometown.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1-35.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Taylor Swift's Mom's Devastating Cancer Battle Affected The Singer's Life And Career In Profound Ways">Taylor Swift's Mom's Devastating Cancer Battle Affected The Singer's Life And Career In Profound Ways</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's personal and professional lives changed when her mom Andrea Swift was diagnosed with cancer several years ago.</p><p>The lyric, “All that time you were throwin’ punches, I was buildin’ something” is said to reference the feud that Swift and Kardashian were in following Kanye's hijacking of Swift's award win.

Or, at the very least, may reference her. Fans believe the lyrics refer to an edited phone call Kardashian and Kanye shared with Swift, attempting to lessen the song feud they once had.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“When the first stone’s thrown, they’re screamin’ / In the streets, there’s a raging riot / When it’s “Burn the b-tch,” they’re shrieking / When the truth comes out, it’s quiet."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/brutal-ticket-scams-are-just-one-frustrating-problem-taylor-swift-fans-have-faced-during-her-epic-eras-tour-1.jpg><p>The song also references snakes, which is an emoji Kardashian once used on Instagram to describe Taylor Swift, according got Just Jared. On top of this, Swift appears to take a <strong>shot at the entire Kardashian/Jenner family as a whole, describing them as "pure greed"</strong>.</p><p>"Cassandra" may or may not be about Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. But fans sure think it is. But that's the beauty of Taylor Swift's music; she always leaves her songs up for interpretation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lo6S7qL%2BMmpmoraRisrl5waiwn6qZmrulv4ykoKZlm5a%2Fpa3SoaCapl2pvLPA1KucnWWgpLK1v4ydnKmZoqm6prrTaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tupac-talks-hit-em-up-vs-who-shot-ya-pg-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tupac Talks Hit Em Up Vs.
