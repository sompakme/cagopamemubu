Sometimes, you'll be right. Sometimes, you'll be wrong. For most people, they don't know where the line in the sand needs to be drawn with regard to age difference. Luckily, there's a golden rule that can be used to help you decide if an age difference should be considered "weird." It's not a golden rule, but more of a rule of thumb.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The "half-your-age-plus-seven" rule is exactly what it sounds like. Whenever wondering if it's socially acceptable for a couple with an age difference to be together, take the age of the older person, cut it in half, and add seven. For example, if someone is 18 (half their age is 9, plus seven is 16), then the youngest person that would be socially acceptable for that person to date is 16. After all, two years isn't a big deal, right? Most countries have Romeo-and-Juliet laws that make it so a legal adult can have consensual sex with a minor, so long as they're within a few years of age.</p><p>The celebrities on this list, however, typically paid no attention to the half-your-age-plus-seven rule. You'll be surprised to know what type of girl your favorite rock stars, actors, and celebrities are attracted to. Be warned: some of these are disgusting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jerry-seinfeld---he-was-38-she-17>Jerry Seinfeld - He was 38, She 17</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jerry Seinfeld</a> is a comedian you either love or you hate. You either think his sitcom is one of the best-scripted television shows on the planet -- or you can't stand to watch it for five seconds.</p><p>While he was still filming Seinfeld, he fell in love with Shoshanna Lonstein, who was a 17-year-old high school senior at the time. Seinfeld was 38. As a lifelong fan, it's impossible to defend that kind of age difference. What could they possibly have had in common?</p><p>Lonstein switched from GW to UCLA to be closer to Seinfeld while he filmed his show. After dating for four years, the couple went their separate ways. Lonstein said she missed New York City too much to live in California and that the constant press coverage was too overwhelming for her.</p><h2 id=tyga---dated-kylie-jenner>Tyga - Dated Kylie Jenner</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tyga</a> is known for two things: "Rack City" and dating <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie Jenner</a>. The latter began when Tyga was 25 years of age, and Kylie was only 17. Their relationship has since been incredibly public because... you know... she's a Jenner. Her entire life is built off of being in the public eye.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two met while Tyga was performing at Kendall Jenner's sweet sixteen party. For those completely out of the Kardashian/Jenner loop, it means that Kylie would have been 14 at the time, but Tyga would have been in his twenties. Pro tip: if you met her while performing at her older sister's sweet sixteen party, she's too young for you, bro.</p><h2 id=joel-madden---he-dated-a-teenage-hilary-duff>Joel Madden - He Dated A Teenage Hilary Duff</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joel Madden</a> is the lead vocalist for band Good Charlotte. Even if you don't know his name, you've probably heard of Good Charlotte or, at the very least, heard a Good Charlotte song. They were huge in the early 2000s when punk temporarily went mainstream. They played The Anthem, Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous, Girls & Boys, and many other songs that appealed to angsty teenagers despite the band members being well into their 20s.</p><p>In 2004, Joel Madden was rumored to have been secretly dating <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hilary Duff</a>. Duff was 16-years-old, and Madden was 25. You can see why the couple wanted to keep things on the down low.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Hilary Duff was finally 18, her mother stated that the pair were dating in an interview with Seventeen Magazine. A year and a bit after their relationship went public, the couple broke up.</p><p>A month later, Madden began dating <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole Richie</a>, who is now his wife and mother of his two children.</p><h2 id=chad-michael-murray---proposed-to-high-school-senior>Chad Michael Murray - Proposed To High School Senior</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chad Michael Murray</a> is best known for playing Lucas Scott on the show One Tree Hill. During the early 2000s, pretty much every teenage girl had dreams about dating him. One girl, Kenzie Dalton, got to live the dream.</p><p>Chad Michael Murray met Kenzie Dalton on the set of One Tree Hill, where she appeared as an extra. It's a little fitting that Murray fell for a high school girl because he played one on television. When they began dating, Murray was 24, but Dalton was only 17.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2006, Murray proposed to Dalton while she was still a senior in high school. Seven years after the engagement, the couple quietly ended their engagement and went their separate ways. I feel bad for whoever dated Kenzie Dalton after Murray. How do you compete with that guy?</p><h2 id=paul-walker---dated-16-year-old>Paul Walker - Dated 16-Year-Old</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul Walker</a> was loved by many for his role in the&nbsp;Fast & Furious&nbsp;franchise. He could have used his fame to become the latest Hollywood playboy, but he found a woman that made him want to be a better man. That woman was Jasmine Pilchard-Gosnell, his girlfriend at the time of his death.</p><p>People remember Walker for his acting career, which is wonderful, but ignore the fact that Jasmine Pilchard-Gosnell was 17 years younger than he. When they first started dating, Jasmine Pilchard-Gosnell was 16 years old. Walker was 33. He could have had any supermodel that he wanted but instead chose a girl that dreamed of taking him to her high school prom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Paul Walker had a daughter, Meadow Walker, with another woman. Meadow lived with her mother for 13 years, before moving in with her father in 2011. Jasmine Pilchard-Gosnell acted as a stepmother for Meadow when she moved in with Paul Walker despite their being closer in age to sisters than mother-daughter.</p><h2 id=wilmer-valderrama---30-year-old-fez-dated-17-year-old-demi-lovato>Wilmer Valderrama - 30-Year-Old Fez Dated 17-Year-Old Demi Lovato</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wilmer Valderrama</a> is probably the only celebrity that has a more unusual name than the character he played on television. You may remember him (but not recognize him) as Fez from That 70's Show. He's developed a habit of dating underage girls.</p><p>It all started when he started dating <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mandy Moore</a>, who was 16 years old at the time, and he was 20. It's not so bad. It doesn't pass the half-your-age-plus-seven rule, but it's not too bad. Four years later, Valderrama hooked up with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lindsay Lohan</a> when she was 17. Following this hookup, Valderrama dated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Demi Lovato</a> for six years. Lovato was 17 when they began dating, whereas Valderrama was 30. It's not the biggest age difference on this list, but it's definitely weird.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>How can the guy who played Fez not find a girl his age? All he has to do is put on the accent he used in the show, and he's set.</p><h2 id=elvis---14-year-old-priscilla-beaulieu>Elvis - 14-Year-Old Priscilla Beaulieu</h2><p>When <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elvis</a> met his future wife, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Priscilla Beaulieu</a>, she was only 14 years old. He was 24. Their relationship was sexual in nature but often portrayed as innocent love. The couple would spend hours at a time hidden in Elvis's room. He told her parents that they were practicing music; in reality, they were bumpin' uglies. However, Priscilla wasn't the first teenage girl to be wooed by Elvis.</p><p>Many a mother questioned why Elvis wanted to take their daughters into private side rooms of venues. The mother of 14-year-old Jackie Rowland caught Elvis trying to teach her daughter how to kiss like an adult and asked if he could take her to a bar that night. The mother said no, but Elvis promised he would be with Jackie when she grew up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many former members of Presley's entourage have said that his attraction for young girls made them uncomfortable. He would refer to the girls as his "cherries" and get different members of his entourage to pick them from the crowd for him. Often times, Elvis wouldn't have sex with them -- he would lay in a bed naked fondling and kissing them.</p><h2 id=r-kelly---dated-15-year-old-aaliyah>R. Kelly - Dated 15-Year-Old Aaliyah</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">R. Kelly</a> is thought of as one of the greatest R&B singers of all time, but he's also known as kind of a weirdo. For years, journalists have been digging up strange stories about him. Two of the most prevalent stories involve underage girls: one, he filmed himself having sex with and peeing on, and the other, he illegally married.</p><p>When she was just 12 years old, rising star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aaliyah</a> was introduced to R Kelly by her uncle, Barry Hankerson. Three years later, when Aaliyah was 15 (and R Kelly was 27), the couple were rumored to be illegally married in a secret wedding ceremony. The marriage was annulled a few months later, and both R Kelly and Aaliyah denied that the marriage had ever happened. Both were insistent that they had always remained friends, nothing more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There ain't nothing wrong with a little Bump 'N' Grind, unless, of course, the girl you want to bump and/or grind with is underage.</p><h2 id=justin-gaston---dated-16-year-old-miley-cyrus>Justin Gaston - Dated 16-Year-Old Miley Cyrus</h2><p>If you haven't heard of Justin Gaston, don't worry -- you're not completely out of touch. His claims to fame are a brief acting/music/modeling career and a brief relationship with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miley Cyrus</a>.</p><p>When Gaston and Cyrus started dating, he was 20, and she was 16. Four years age difference isn't normally a big deal, but it doesn't pass the half-your-age-plus-seven test, making it a little weird.</p><p>It's unfortunate that Gaston was never able to establish a career for himself. He's literally known as the guy that dated Miley Cyrus. Try to find a news story involving Justin Gaston where Miley Cyrus isn't mentioned. It's almost laughable. Cyrus is even mentioned in news articles about Gaston's newborn child!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kobe-bryant---17-year-old-vanessa-wife>Kobe Bryant - 17-Year-Old Vanessa (Wife)</h2><p>Besides being one of the most iconic basketball players of all time, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kobe Bryant</a>&nbsp;also speaks fluent Italian after having spent his childhood in Italy and enjoys conducting press interviews in Spanish. Another thing you may not know about Kobe Bryant is that when he proposed to his now-wife, Vanessa Bryant, she was still in high school.</p><p>It's not too big of a deal. Kobe was 21 years old, and met 17-year-old Vanessa Laine while she was working as a background dancer in the music video for Tha Eastsidaz' music video "G'd Up." Within no time, the two began dating. Six months later, Kobe proposed.</p><p>The wedding was controversial within Kobe Bryant's family. His parents opposed him marrying so young, and to someone who wasn't African-American. His wedding wasn't attended by his parents, his two sisters, his agent, or any of his L.A. Laker teammates.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sonny-bono---he-was-27-and-cher-was-16>Sonny Bono - He was 27 and Cher was 16</h2><p>The romance between Sonny Bono and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cher</a> is one of the most iconic Hollywood romances. Bono, who was an established singer, helped Cher land gigs&nbsp;before the two of them decided that they should pair up. They loved each other -- despite Bono being 27 years old when he met 16-year-old Cher. The couple married in 1964 when Cher was 18 (and legal).</p><p>Eleven years after their marriage, the duo divorced. It was an ugly, public divorce that probably ruined a lot of people's perception of true love. The couple had been in the public eye for 11 years, had a music career together, and even hosted their own television show together.</p><p>After going their separate ways, both tried to launch their independent entertainment careers. Sonny Bono launched his show,&nbsp;The Sonny Comedy Revue, which was canceled six weeks after its debut. He started his political career soon after. On the other hand, Cher ended up becoming pretty famous. You might have heard her referred to as the&nbsp;Goddess of Pop.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=david-bowie-jimmy-page---dated-15-year-old>David Bowie / Jimmy Page - Dated 15-Year-Old</h2><p>To say <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">David Bowie</a> was a little out there is an understatement. He was a pretty offbeat person. He dressed strangely, embraced his homosexuality (and later his bisexuality) in a time when it wasn't publicly accepted, and put together concerts that people enjoyed for the visual stimulation just as much as the audio component. But as famous and iconic as he was, he took the virginity of an underage fan.</p><p>Lori Mattix (sometimes spelled Maddox) was part of the groupie scene as a young teenager. She spent the years of her adolescence hanging around rockers and trying to sleep with the men she lusted for. One of those men was David Bowie and, not long after, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jimmy Page</a>.</p><p>Jimmy Page spent a little bit of time with Lori Mattix after Bowie. Starting when she was 15, Page went on to have a fairly sexual relationship with Mattix. He tried his best to keep their relationship private, often keeping her behind closed doors so his highly illegal relationship wouldn't get out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ted-nugent---allegedly-dated-13-year-old>Ted Nugent -&nbsp;Allegedly Dated 13-Year-Old</h2><p>To say that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ted Nugent</a> has a problem with underage girls is an understatement. He wrote a song called "Jailbait," and if it were written by someone with a clean history, we might have been able to assume it wasn't factual or based in Ted Nugent's reality. Unfortunately, Nugent has stated, many times, often in a bragging manner, that he has had sex with underage girls.</p><p>Only two years before recording "Jailbait," Nugent became the legal guardian of a 17-year-old girl when he was 30 years old. Somehow, he managed to convince the girl's parents that because he couldn't marry her -- and it would be strange for her to live with him without being married -- it would be best if he legally adopted her. So he did. And they agreed. For some reason.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It gets worse. In "Jailbait," Nugent mentions that the girl in the song is 13. There have been allegations that Nugent has engaged in sexual acts with prepubescent girls. To be more specific, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Courtney Love</a> said that Nugent told her to perform oral sex on him when she was twelve-and-a-half years old. Nugent denies these allegations.</p><h2 id=bill-wyman---47-year-old-dated-13-year-old-mandy-smith>Bill Wyman - 47-Year-Old Dated 13-Year-Old Mandy Smith</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill Wyman</a> was the bass guitarist for The Rolling Stones. It's concerning that Wyman, David Bowie, and Jimmy Page are on this list. Those guys could have had anyone that they wanted -- so why did they pick&nbsp;girls that were underage?</p><p>Wyman's love for underage girls is a little more disturbing than Jimmy Page's, as hard as that is to believe. At the age of 47, Wyman began dating 13-year-old Mandy Smith. The relationship was approved by the girl's mother but scrutinized by the media. The couple went on to get married&nbsp;but divorced in 1993, ten years after their relationship began.</p><p>The relationship was definitely sexual. Mandy Smith revealed that she and Wyman first had sex when she was only 14 years old.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wyman says that his relationship was emotional and special. Despite this, Mandy's older sister demanded that Wyman be prosecuted for his open relationship with a girl so young. Police have&nbsp;not investigated Wyman for this incredibly creepy (and highly illegal) relationship.</p><h2 id=chuck-berry---alleged-pedo>Chuck Berry - Alleged Pedo</h2><p>While it's considered bad manners to speak ill&nbsp;of the recently deceased, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chuck Berry</a> (who passed away in March 2017) was somewhat of a pervert. That's not just speculation -- it's been proven in a court of law.</p><p>At the peak of his career, Berry was arrested for transporting a 14-year-old girl across state lines so that it would be legal for him to have sex with her. Additionally, police found quite the pornographic stash in his possession, some of which contained materials of underage girls. He was charged with three counts of child abuse for possessing underage p---------y. The charges were dropped after Berry (who filed a lawsuit against&nbsp;county prosecutor, William J. Hannah) struck a no-jail plea deal, leading him to drop his lawsuit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to having sex with underage girls, a 1994 investigative report in Spy Magazine revealed that Chuck Berry had a fetish for watching women when they didn't want to be watched. He installed a number of cameras in the women's bathroom of a restaurant he bought and was later sued for owning rolls and rolls of videotape of women defecating.</p><p><strong>Sources: dailymail.co.uk, wikipedia, nbcchicago, usmagazine.com</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2Ysq2xwaxksqelYrGqsM2tZKSmn6x6pa3TnptmrZ6ZsrOtxp5koKGiocBw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./15-reasons-leonardo-dicaprio-is-the-real-barney-stinson.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Reasons Leonardo DiCaprio Is The Real Barney Stinson">&larr;
