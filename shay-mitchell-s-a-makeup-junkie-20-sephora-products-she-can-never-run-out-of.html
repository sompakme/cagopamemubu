Working with makeup artists while filming, Mitchell has picked up her own tips and tricks on what kind of makeup and skincare works best for her. You can pretty much call the brunette beauty a makeup junkie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Besides acting, makeup has become one of Mitchell's passions and she has even uploaded her first ever makeup tutorial on YouTube last summer. In her video, she shares her favorite makeup brands and how she does a simple everyday look. While you may assume that being a Hollywood star, Mitchell only uses high-end makeup brands that can cost up to hundreds of dollars, surprisingly, the beauty expert actually gets most of her items from Sephora.</p><p>While shopping at the beauty store, Shay Mitchell has her go-to products she always has to pick up. These products are some of her favorites, and these include the Glam Glow face masks, Becca Highlighters, and Nars creamy concealer. Whenever she's running low on these makeup items and the 17 others on this list, you'll definitely catch the star at her favorite Sephora&nbsp;store.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gets-her-glow-on-with-glam-glow-face-masks><strong>Gets Her Glow On With Glam Glow Face Masks</strong></h2><p>How is it that Shay Mitchell always manages to have that beautiful glow wherever she is? The Pretty Little Liars star talked to Teen Vogue where she gave up her skin routine to get that perfect and flawless face. Besides mentioning that she's a moisturizing queen, the actress said that she swears by Glam Glow's face masks.</p><p><strong>"I try to use a face mask every other night or at least once a week,"</strong></p><p>Mitchell shared. You can find multiple Glam Glow products at your favorite Sephora, and the standard size costs about $70. One of the brand's more popular face masks is the Supermud Clearing Treatment, which is designed to visibly clear a person's complexion from pores, acne and blemishes, and oiliness. So if you were wondering how Shay has such perfect skin, maybe try a sample of Glam Glow!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=makes-sure-to-blend-her-foundation-with-beauty-blenders><strong>Makes Sure To Blend Her Foundation With Beauty Blenders</strong></h2><p>Many beauty experts swear by beauty blenders to perfectly blend in your foundation, concealer, and even contour. Shay has learned from the best makeup artists while on set and is pretty much a master at blending. One Beauty Blender is $20, but goes a long way. Well, that is if your dog doesn't find it. Before dabbing the product on your skin to blend in your favorite foundation,</p><p><strong>many makeup artists recommend soaking the beauty sponge in some water so that it is damp before starting your application.</strong></p><p>The brand even mentioned on its Instagram, "One of the reasons we always say you need to wet your blender is because water causes the sponge to swell and it ensures your makeup won't be absorbed ... which results in less makeup waste."</p><h2 id=la-mer-longwear-foundation-is-her-favorite><strong>La Mer Longwear Foundation Is Her Favorite</strong></h2><p>No one has perfect skin.</p><p><strong>Even someone as beautiful and talented like Shay Mitchell admits that she struggled with imperfections.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Foundation goes a long way to help with covering blemishes and spots, and one of Mitchell's favorite foundations is La Mer's The Soft Fluid Long Wear Foundation. She goes for a warm shade and blends it all in with her beauty blender. For Shay, it's a perfect foundation, even though it runs her $110 a bottle. The product claims to leave your pores refined and your imperfections virtually gone, while SPF and antioxidants help protect your complexion.</p><h2 id=nars-creamy-concealer-to-hide-dark-spots><strong>Nars Creamy Concealer To Hide Dark Spots</strong></h2><p>To sculpt her features, Shay loves to pick up Nars Creamy Concealer in the shades Honey and Medium Ginger. The concealer is a cult classic, used by a number of stars from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie Jenner</a> to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bella Hadid</a>. There are a number of shades to match anyone's skin shade and it really helps to hide blemishes, which Mitchell admits to having from time to time. She isn't afraid to tell people that she suffers from a pimple here and there because she's normal just like anyone else. According to an article from Glamour,</p><p><strong>Shay Mitchell likes to use the two concealer shades down the middle of her nose and through her T-zone.</strong></p><p>The Nars concealer goes for $30.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tarte-shape-tape-concealer-is-another-must-for-shay><strong>Tarte&nbsp;Shape Tape Concealer Is Another Must For Shay</strong></h2><p>While Shay's shopping for her must-haves at Sephora, she also has to pick up her second favorite concealer, Tarte's Shape Tape Contour Concealer in Medium. It is a beloved makeup item by many beauty experts because it's full coverage, so if Shay ever has a dark spot, this concealer will definitely do the trick. The actress uses wide swaths over and under her eyes, chin, and beneath her nose. It is a little less pricier than the Nars concealer, going for $27 at Sephora, but it basically does the same thing. Bendable and brightening, the shape tape really helps, especially when Shay needs to wake up early in the morning to film.</p><h2 id=laura-mercier-translucent-powder><strong>Laura Mercier Translucent Powder</strong></h2><p>In Shay Mitchell's makeup video, which you can easily find on YouTube, one of the star's favorite setting powders is the Laura Mercier Translucent Setting Powder.</p><p><strong>Shay likes to use the powder in the areas where she highlights her skin, and also underneath her eyes and the middle of her forehead.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Translucent powder became huge when makeup artists began "baking." The term refers to letting translucent powder sit on your face for a few minutes, which sets the base of your foundation and later, you simply dust it off. It still is a great item to have and use during your everyday makeup routine. The Laura Mercier powder costs $38.</p><h2 id=kelley-baker-s-brow-pencil-for-the-perfect-eyebrows><strong>Kelley Baker's Brow Pencil For The Perfect Eyebrows</strong></h2><p>Shay Mitchell has a great set of eyebrows, thanks to Kelley Baker and her brow defining pencils, which go for about $22. Stars like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Khloe Kardashian</a> love getting their eyebrows done by Baker herself, but when they can't (we know we can't...), they try their best to do it themselves. Shay knows a thing or two about creating the perfect brow, though.</p><p><strong>Even Baker admitted that the star has "got filling in her brows down!"</strong></p><p>Mitchell even has a few videos showing her fans how she fills in her perfect-looking brows, and it takes her just a handful of seconds to make them appear more defined and "on point."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tarte-mascara-to-get-long-lashes><strong>Tarte Mascara To Get Long Lashes</strong></h2><p>Not everyone was born with long eyelashes and Shay knows how to make her eyelashes look full and long with her favorite mascara from Tarte. During an interview with PopSugar, the Pretty Little Liars actress stated that along with her eyelash curler,</p><p><strong>she loves using Tarte's Lights, Camera, Lashes 4-in-1 Mascara, which you can find at Sephora for about $23.</strong></p><p>The mascara promises to lengthen, curl, give volume, and even condition your eyelashes. If Shay's using it, we're sure it's a winner. However, if you're not really into spending $20 or more so dollars on mascara, then you should know that Shay's also a big fan of CoverGirl's LashBlast Volume Mascara, which is only $6.29 at Target.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cover-fx-contour-kit-to-sculpt-her-face><strong>Cover FX Contour Kit To Sculpt Her Face</strong></h2><p>Shay Mitchell has amazing bone structure, but it doesn't help to define and sculpt her face a tad bit more. In one of her makeup tutorials on YouTube, the Pretty Little Liars star uses one of her favorite makeup items, the Cover FX Contour Kit. Using the lightest shade, Shay highlights under the eye, on her T-zone, and down the middle of her nose. She uses the tip of the beauty blender and dabs the shade until it's fully blended. She also mentions that she uses the other colors if she ever has a white spot on her face. The Cover FX is a great base for Shay's face, and it appears that she uses a lot of it if you look at her palette. The contour kit costs $48, and there are five different finishes so that all skin tones can find their best shades.</p><h2 id=teamed-up-with-smashbox-to-create-the-coolest-eyeshadow-palettes><strong>Teamed Up With Smashbox&nbsp;To Create The&nbsp;Coolest Eyeshadow Palettes</strong></h2><p>Shay Mitchell got the opportunity of a lifetime when Smashbox wanted to partner with her to create seven drop-dead gorgeous eye shadow palettes. The palettes are all really pretty and range from metallic to smoky to soft subtle shades. Perfect for everyone. They are highly pigmented and each palette contains six beautiful shades and two base shades. So these palettes are really all anyone needs. You can make endless amounts of looks with each of the palettes, so whether you're a lover of a sexy smoky eye or just like a simple everyday eye shadow look, you can find it in one of these awesome palettes. Each Smashbox eye shadow palette goes for $29.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shares-the-secret-to-highlighting-her-face><strong>Shares The Secret To Highlighting Her Face</strong></h2><p>If you just love Shay Mitchell's highlight and perfect glow, then you'll want to purchase the Charlotte Tilbury Filmstar Bronze & Glow Palette, which will cost you $68.</p><p><strong>Shay shares her secret for highlighting and admitted that one should follow a "V" shape for the perfect highlight.</strong></p><p>Mitchell "likes to highlight on the top part of my cheek right here and a little bit on my eyebrow. Patrick told me to do a "V" shape so that is how I remember." The palette is beautiful and helps to slim and define your face, like the hollows of your cheeks, temples, jawline, and the sides and tips of your nose.</p><h2 id=dose-of-colors-baked-browns-eyeshadow-palette-is-one-of-her-top-5-makeup-essentials><strong>Dose Of Colors Baked Browns Eyeshadow Palette Is One Of Her Top 5 Makeup Essentials</strong></h2><p>If you were wondering what this brunette beauty's favorite eyeshadow palette was, you're in luck! In a video posted by Byrdie, Shay Mitchell shared her Top 5 Makeup Essentials, and one of them was this beautiful Dose of Colors Baked Browns eye shadow palette, which costs $32. She loves this palette because</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"you can go from a smokier look or just make it look natural, bring it from day into night, super easy palette you can throw in your purse."</strong></p><p>There are five tones in this warm-toned shaded palette, and they have a buttery feel that goes on smoothly on your eyes. No wonder it's a favorite for Shay.</p><h2 id=becca-light-chaser-highlighter-champagne-dream><strong>Becca Light Chaser Highlighter Champagne Dream</strong></h2><p>Shay Mitchell raves about this Becca highlighter and not only because of its "orange bronzy" tint, but because it is small enough to fit in her small purse. Shay loves the texture of this highlighter because it gives her the "perfect kind of sheen" to her face so she's not overly glowing. The Becca Light Chaser Highlighter promises to make your best features shine through, and we could definitely see that on Shay. Her skin is always glowing and not in a shiny, oily way either. The highlighter is a popular product at Sephora and retails for about $34.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shay-s-makeup-artist-swears-by-tom-ford-shade-and-illuminate><strong>Shay's Makeup Artist Swears By Tom Ford Shade And Illuminate</strong></h2><p>Shay Mitchell uses a lot of products to highlight and contour her face. One of the many products her makeup artist Patrick Ta uses to contour Shay's face is the Tom Ford Shade and Illuminate palette. He stated,</p><p><strong>"I love this for medium skin tones because it's dewy, easy to blend, and has a great finish that compliments the skin well when creating dimension."</strong></p><p>If you follow Shay Mitchell on the gram, then you'll definitely notice that Patrick is always making the actress look her best and gives her that signature golden glow we all envy. The Tom Ford palette will cost you about $82.</p><h2 id=giorgio-armani-lip-maestro-202-is-her-absolute-favorite><strong>Giorgio Armani Lip Maestro 202 Is Her Absolute Favorite</strong></h2><p>For lips, one of Shay Mitchell's all-time favorite lipsticks is the Giorgio Armani Lip Maestro 202 in Dolci. She prefers to dab on her lipstick rather than smear it&nbsp;across her upper and lower lip&nbsp;because she admits doing so is too much of a "commitment." She likes to test out the lipstick before fully covering her lips in it (which we can all agree is very smart, especially when you're trying on a long-lasting color that often stains your lips), but when it comes to this product, Mitchell will not be afraid to smear away. The shade is perfect for her skin tone and the touch of pink looks perfect for an everyday look, which she has a YouTube video on. The lipstick costs $38.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=no-blush-for-this-star><strong>No Blush For This Star</strong></h2><p>While Shay Mitchell might wear blush on the red carpet for a glamorous event or for a photoshoot, the star has admitted that she isn't a huge fan of wearing blush. In her YouTube video, Shay states that every makeup artist she works with knows that she isn't the biggest blush enthusiast.</p><p><strong>"I don't want to be too rosy. I don't want to be too cheeky. I just like a little bit of blush,"</strong></p><p>she said in her YouTube video. It doesn't really matter to us though; Shay looks good with or without blush on her face.</p><h2 id=using-biore-pore-strips-to-get-rid-of-blackheads><strong>Using Biore Pore Strips To Get Rid Of Blackheads</strong></h2><p>The Pretty Little Liars actress has been a spokesperson for Biore Pore Stripes and actually uses them quite often. In an interview with Glamour magazine, she mentioned that the pore strips, which help clear out her blackheads, are one of her favorite skin treatments. "What I like to do is run my fingers under the tap quick, then wet my nose so it's a little bit moist. Then, I take the strip and put it on. But what I was doing wrong for a while was peeling it off incorrectly. I'd peel it off from one side to another, but you're actually supposed to have both fingers on both ends and peel it off in one movement," she explained to her fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=uses-kiehl-s-midnight-recovery-eye-concentrate-for-her-skin-care-routine><strong>Uses Kiehl's Midnight Recovery Eye Concentrate For Her Skin Care Routine</strong></h2><p>Shay makes sure she takes care of her skin, especially her face. She has a skincare routine she always follows, and one of the items she uses includes the Kiehl's Midnight Recovery Eye Concentrate. The product detail reads,</p><p><strong>"leaves under eye skin feeling strengthened and replenished, diminishes the appearance of fine lines, reduces puffiness and dark under eye circles and improves microcirculation and reduces inflammation."</strong></p><p>Shay Mitchell might need to use this item when she's been up all day filming or out all night with some friends and has to get back to work in the early morning hours. The eye treatment will cost you about $37.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=includes-innovative-skincare-active-serum-in-her-skincare><strong>Includes Innovative Skincare Active Serum In Her Skincare</strong></h2><p>The star admits that she's a moisture queen and during her skin care routine, she "swears by" Innovative Skincare Active Serum, which is an age-defying, protective, and regenerative serum for the skin. The product aims to improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and evens the complexion, which is supposed to make you look younger (not that Shay needs that right now, but it's always good to think ahead). Overall, the serum helps improve&nbsp;the health and integrity of your skin. It seems to be working for Shay, who always looks flawless and appears to never age! The serum is pricey and will cost you about $135 for an ounce.</p><h2 id=last-but-not-least-coconut-oil-is-a-must><strong>Last But Not Least, Coconut Oil Is A Must</strong></h2><p>Out of all of her beauty must-haves, Shay Mitchell is a big fan of none other than coconut oil. She admits that she's a little obsessed with using it for her dry spots because it's natural.</p><p><strong>"Coconut oil has always been my favorite. Any dry spots I have I'll put coconut oil on them because it's a natural ingredient and it works better than anything. I can use it in my hair and everywhere else: cooking too! It's something I've grown up with,"</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mitchell has said. So ladies (and men, too), make sure that you grab some coconut oil after splurging at Sephora for all the things Shay loves! After all, it's not like buying a jar of coconut oil will set you back more than about $15. So, it's definitely worth it!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmoaGXnXqttcWeZqygka56rrXTnJ%2BepJyoeqJ5zJqinq2gYre2usqinGZqYGLAprzHqKmaZaCnvKXBwq2qZquYmnqkrc1mpZ6ulad6s8HNZqaurF2ks3A%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./steve-buscemi-s-wife-jo-andres-dead-at-65.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Steve Buscemis Wife Jo Andres Dead at 65">&larr;
