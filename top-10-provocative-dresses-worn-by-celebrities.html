Paparazzi would definitely not miss any second to see and report about the outfit of these celebrities. Most showbiz oriented programs would have designers as guests to help them evaluate which dress is the most elegant, conservative, dull or even provocative.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the course of the last decade or so, there have been quite a lot of stars who have strutted the red carpet with dresses that are pretty wild. So, here are the top ten provocative dresses worn by famous celebrities.</p><h2 id=10-sharon-stone-s-side-boobs-dress><b>10. Sharon Stone’s Side Boobs Dress</b></h2><p>The 55-year old actress proved that age does not matter when it comes to dressing up with style. <a title="Sharon Stone Net Worth" href=#>Sharon Stone</a> wore a Red Roberto Cavalli dress during this year’s Cannes Film Festival, which had a slit that went almost near her nether regions. Her dress earned the admiration of the crowd, as it looked very daring yet elegant. Clearly, Sharon Stone has a lot to teach people when it comes to dressing and fashion.</p><h2 id=9-beyonc-s-body-suit><b>9. Beyoncé’s Body Suit</b></h2><p><a title="Beyonce Net Worth" href=#>Beyoncé</a> has always been known for her sexy moves and it is one of the things that her fans just love about her. She always dazzles the people with her fitting dresses and gowns but what made much noise was the bodysuit she wore on the Mrs. Carter Show World tour. She wore her bodysuit with gold embroidery, with a cover for her nipples. This has been her trend for quite some time already.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-anne-hathaway-racy-see-through-dress><b>8. Anne Hathaway Racy See-Through Dress</b></h2><p>The sexy <a title="Anne Hathaway Net Worth" href=#>Anne Hathaway</a> seems to always leave the crowd in awe, thanks to her style. With her racy see-through dress together with her platinum hair style, the actress was definitely in one of her experimental moods. The star arrived at the Metropolitan Museum of Art for the 2013 Met Ball showing off a great deal of sexy cleavage. She seems to be telling everyone that she’s done with the demure looks and is ready to flaunt her sexiness. With her dress, she decided to go braless. She might have worn a provocative dress but it is undeniable that she still looked elegant.</p><h2 id=7-lindsay-lohan-s-short-black-dress><b>7. Lindsay Lohan’s Short Black dress</b></h2><p><a title="Lindsay Lohan Net Worth" href=#>Lindsay Lohan</a> has always loved buying transparent dresses and it is no longer new for people to see her dresses worn provocatively. She was seen in a club wearing a see-through short black dress that can very much expose her breasts. Her nipples were visible as she did not wear any bra or underwear. She walked confidently in and out of the club without minding the watchful eyes of the public and paparazzi. She was even quoted for saying that she’d dare go to the Oscars naked if allowed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=6-irina-shayk-plunging-black-gown><b>6. Irina Shayk Plunging Black Gown</b></h2><p>The model <a title="Irina Shayk Net Worth" href=#>Irina Shayk</a> wore a plunging black gown at the Cannes Film Festival. She was clearly out to turn the heads of people after she revealed her sexy body with her gown. It was so sexy that it almost exposed her breasts, thanks to some minor wardrobe malfunction. Her gown was designed by Roberto Cavalli. It was covered with sequins and beading, making it a lot more show-stopping. And as it fell to the floor, the skirt revealed just how sexy her legs were through the stripes of the sheer panels. One more thing: the sheerness of the outfit left her lace thong visible for everybody on the red carpet to see.</p><h2 id=5-katy-perry-s-glittering-zuhair-murad-dress><b>5. Katy Perry’s Glittering Zuhair Murad Dress</b></h2><p><a title="Katy Perry Net Worth" href=#>Katy Perry</a> has been known for her sexy outfits but this glittering dress simply amazed a lot of people.

Elizabeth Hurley’s No Blouse and Only a Sari</b></h2><p><a title="Elizabeth Hurley Net Worth" href=#>Elizabeth Hurley</a> left nothing for others to imagine as she went without a blouse and instead had a sari on when she attended the Love Ball in England. Her breast looked proud and high as it was made visible for photographers and fans. However, she felt quite exposed after a while as she placed a folder on her visible bosom.</p><h2 id=3-rihanna-s-see-through-short-dress><b>3. Rihanna’s See-through Short Dress</b></h2><p><a title="Rihanna Net Worth" href=#>Rihanna</a> has never been a stranger when it comes to courting controversy with her sexy outfits. She showed herself to the world in a whole new level as she arrived at a nightclub in Hollywood with a completely see-through dress. She wore no bra with the sheer fabric, showing her skimpy black underwear.</p><h2 id=2-candice-boucher-s-black-see-through-dress><b>2. Candice Boucher’s Black See-Through Dress</b></h2><p>If she planned to make an impression at the Cannes Film festival, she definitely succeeded.

Her dress was made out of sheer black material with black embroidery, allowing everybody to see just how sexy she is. The dress was designed by Gavin Rajah.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1-jennifer-lopez-green-versace-dress><b>1. Jennifer Lopez' Green Versace Dress</b></h2><p>The famous American actress and recording artist <a title="Jennifer Lopez Net Worth" href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a> wore a plunging exotic green Versace silk chiffon dress to the Grammy Awards in the year 2000. This dress was voted as the fifth most iconic dresses of all time. It was designed by <a title="Donatella Versace Net Worth" href=#>Donatella Versace</a> and was described as tropical green or jungle green with a touch of blue for a more exotic appearance. The see-through silk chiffon dress has a tropical leaf pattern as well as a citrine-studded crotch.
