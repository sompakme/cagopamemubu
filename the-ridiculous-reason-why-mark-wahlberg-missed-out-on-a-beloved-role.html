While Wahlberg never released another song that took the world by storm, there is no doubt that he is far from forgotten.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though it could easily be argued that Mark Wahlberg is luckier than most movie stars given that he overcame his potential one-hit-wonder status, things haven’t worked out perfectly for him. For example, <a href=#>Wahlberg once called out Tom Cruise in public</a> only to later realize that his reasons for being angry at the Hollywood heavyweight were based on a misunderstanding.</p><p>When it comes to Mark Wahlberg’s acting career, there is no doubt that he has been very fortunate in general. However, there was at least one time that things didn’t work out for Wahlberg. After all, Wahlberg missed out on starring in a cult classic movie be cause of a ridiculous choice he made and insisted on.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Ray Liotta Nearly Played This Incredible Mark Wahlberg Character</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=other-roles-wahlberg-missed-out-on>Other Roles Wahlberg Missed Out On</h2><p>Once an actor truly makes it in Hollywood, everything flips on a dime. After all, once an actor is a proven box office draw, they go from spending their time trying to find roles to being offered so many parts that they have to turn a lot of them down. Of course, it should go without saying that every movie star wants to believe that they have good instincts when it comes to the roles they choose to take or pass on. Sadly, that isn’t the case a lot of the time.</p><p>Over the years, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Wahlberg has passed on a long list of movies</a> according to notstarring.com. Fortunately for him, several of the roles that Wahlberg chose to reject were a part of movies that weren’t well-received when they were released. For example, Wahlberg passed on films like Pride and Glory, S.W.A.T., The Black Dahlia, and Infamous among others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately for Mark Wahlberg, the actor turned down the chance to star in several movies that have gone on to be considered classics. For example, Wahlberg rejected the chance to star in an acclaimed movie and that is unfortunate since <a href=#>the making of Brokeback Mountain sounds fascinating</a>. Wahlberg also missed out on another award-winning historical drama, 2005s Cinderella Man. Most notably of all, Wahlberg was in the running to portray Matt Damon’s character in Ocean’s Eleven but obviously, that didn’t work out for Mark.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why Mark Wahlberg Turned Down A Role In Brokeback Mountain</a></span></p><h2 id=a-cult-classic>A Cult Classic</h2><p>In 2001, a unique sci-fi psychological thriller movie called Donnie Darko was released. Unfortunately for everyone involved in Donnie Darko’s production, the movie didn’t perform well at the box office. In fact, according to Wikipedia, Donnie Darko made only a meager $7.5 million at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite Donnie Darko’s less than stellar performance in theaters, loads of people discovered the film when it was released on home media. Even though Donnie Darko is a pretty inscrutable film, there is something about the movie’s tone that appeals to people all over the world. As a result, Donnie Darko has gone on to be considered a cult classic.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About The Origin Of 'Donnie Darko'</a></span></p><h2 id=a-strange-choice>A Strange Choice</h2><p>When most movies come out and flop at the box office, that is an extremely negative thing for all of the actors involved. In fact, there are several examples of actors whose careers have hit the skids after one of their films failed at the box office. On the other end of the spectrum, Jake Gyllenhaal’s career was launched in large part because he starred in Donnie Darko even though the movie flopped in theaters. In fact, people continue to care so much about the film two decades after its release that they were delighted when <a href=#>Gyllenhaal stumbled across his Donnie Darko script</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Considering how helpful Donnie Darko was to Jake Gyllenhaal’s career, it seems safe to assume that Mark Wahlberg wishes he was the one who starred in the film. Incredibly enough, Wahlberg lost out on the chance to star in Donnie Darko for a reason that can only be described as ridiculous.</p><p>Even though Mark Wahlberg turned thirty the same year Donnie Darko was released, he was offered the chance to play the movie’s titular high schooler. Unlike the other films that he turned down the chance to star in, Mark wanted to take the role but Wahlberg lost the chance to star in Donnie Darko because of a strange acting choice he made. For whatever reason, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wahlberg decided that he had to play Donnie Darko with a lisp</a> which was an idea that the movie’s director rejected. After Wahlberg continued to insist on his lisp plans, he was shown the door. Since Wahlberg was far too old to play a high schooler, it is weird enough imagining Mark portraying Donnie Darko without factoring in the lisp.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>According To Mark Wahlberg, This Hollywood Megastar Almost Ruined His Career</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dp7altcKuo6ito2K%2Fpq3SqKVmr5iueq6t0aRksJmYoa%2BmvsZmpKKro5qxbrvUrWSopl2ZvK%2B6yJ5knZmioLxw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-happened-between-kirstie-alley-and-john-travolta.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened Between Kirstie Alley And John Travolta?">&larr;
