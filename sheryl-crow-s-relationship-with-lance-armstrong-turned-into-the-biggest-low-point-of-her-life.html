It seems like negativity has followed the popular athlete since, and <a href=#>that held true for his performance on SNL.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the following, we're going to turn the calendar back to the early 2000s and take a closer look at Lance's three-year relationship with Crow. We're going to reveal why things didn't work out between the two, and why Crow's life took a devastating turn at the time of their breakup. Thankfully, Crow is in a good place these days, and most of all, she's feeling healthy.</p><h2 id=lance-armstrong-told-his-story-as-to-why-the-relationship-with-sheryl-crow-didn-39-t-work>Lance Armstrong Told His Story As To Why The Relationship With Sheryl Crow Didn't Work</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar41889110.jpg><p>Sheryl Crow and Lance Armstrong started to date in 2003, and it caused quite the media storm. The relationship lasted three years, and Armstrong went into detail as to why things didn't work during his conversation alongside Howard Stern. Given Lance's words, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he was sharing a different story compared to his ex Sheryl Crow.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It was a good ride. She’s a great lady. Obviously it didn’t work out, but I think and I hope she’s happy. I’m happy," he told Stern. "I watched the GRAMMYs the other day, and we were like presenters at the GRAMMYs …At the time, I was like, ‘I’ve got to go do what?’"</p><p>"It’s tough to pull it off. I mean, how many couples have been able to pull it off?” he noted. “To her credit, she was a stay-at-home -- one of the biggest rockstars -- but she was a great partner. She was at the races. It wasn’t like we never saw each other.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>How Sheryl Crow Stays In Shape At 60 Years Old</a></span></p><p>Ultimately, Armstrong reveals that their different visions for the future was the biggest reason for their breakup.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"She wanted marriage, she wanted children; and not that I didn’t want that," he wrote. "But I didn’t want that at that time because I had just gotten out of a marriage, I’d just had kids. We’re up against her biological clock -- that pressure is what cracked it.”</p><p>Although the separation didn't seem as bad as the way Armstrong played it out - things were much different from Crow's perspective at the time.</p><h2 id=sheryl-crow-was-going-through-a-breakup-with-lance-armstrong-while-she-was-also-diagnosed-with-cancer>Sheryl Crow Was Going Through A Breakup With Lance Armstrong, While She Was Also Diagnosed With Cancer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sheryl-Crow-and-Lance-Armstrong.jpg><p>For Sheryl Crow, her breakup was truly a rock bottom moment for several reasons. Not only was her relationship in the media, but she was also forced to deal with a cancer diagnosis at the time. Instead of giving the artist her space, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she was peppered by the media at the time</a>, who were doing their best to catch her at an ultimate low.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"When I was diagnosed and my relationship fell apart, people were camped outside trying to get that picture of Sheryl Crow at her lowest moment. I just lost all faith in humankind."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>What Really Happened Between Kid Rock And Sheryl Crow</a></span></p><p>Speaking alongside ABC News, Crow revealed to shedding lots of tears at the time, but also knew the moment could be used as a wake-up call in her life.</p><p>"There were just aspects of my life I had to look at and say, 'What is this? What is this telling me?'" she said. "It's about showing up for yourself. It's about facing that giant machine every morning, being stripped down to just one little person addressing their life. And that was -- that was my wake-up call. I had to be here. I had to show up for myself."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Did Kaley Cuoco And Henry Cavill Date As A Publicity Stunt?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thankfully these days, Crow is cancer-free and a great example as to why it is important to test regularly, before such a diagnosis gets worse.</p><h2 id=sheryl-crow-completely-denied-a-rumour-that-lance-armstrong-had-left-her-because-of-the-diagnosis>Sheryl Crow Completely Denied A Rumour That Lance Armstrong Had Left Her Because Of The Diagnosis</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar52416255.jpg><p>Crow has spoken a little more about her relationship to Armstrong, claiming she was "lied to" following the scandal surrounding the doping that took place at the height of his career.</p><p>However, Crow did address a certain rumor, claiming there was no truth to Armstrong breaking up with her due to the diagnosis.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"No, it was really, I mean, really difficult, you know, just really difficult for both of us," she said. "But it's in those moments when you realize, OK. … This is my life. Your first instinct is to say, OK, I have to have my family here. I've got to rely on my doctors, and I have to surround myself with people who can really carry me through this and who can really be there emotionally for me, like really just consistently be there emotionally."</p><p>Crow would go on to reveal during her 2006 interview that the breakup caused her to make major adjustments.</p><p>"It is like a death, you know. And in many ways it's like having part of your life amputated, but you still have that phantom itch, you know, where you wake up and I'll see something and think, 'Oh, I've got to make sure Lance is hip to this band. I've got to put it on his iPod.' And then I remember, 'Oh, wait, you know, that's not my life.'"</p><p>Despite her many high profile relationships, it doesn't seem like Crow is in one at the moment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqoZ2irrlur9Gorqxlopq5osDIqKWsoJmleri106FkpZmemLJurdGmqq2qn6O0bsPArGSaZZykxG68zqKlrWWfm3qpsdFmo6KelWQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-was-george-michael-s-net-worth-when-he-died.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What was George Michaels net worth when he died?">&larr;
