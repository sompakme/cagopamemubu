With all the drama circulating the internet, it‚Äôs hard to know whether it‚Äôs the tea or the tutorials that keep fans coming back. We‚Äôve compiled a list of the most infamous beauty guru fights to grace the front pages of YouTube and Twitter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The more perceptive among us might notice a common denominator between the feuds outlined in this list. See if you can figure out what (or who) it might be.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Makeup Looks To Try For Your FaceTime Date</a></span></p><h2 id=jackie-ania-and-jaclyn-hill><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Jackie Ania and Jaclyn Hill</span></h2><p>Back in 2019, Jacklyn Hill launched her ill-fated cosmetics brand. Fans reported finding pieces of hair and plastic embedded in Jaclyn‚Äôs lipsticks and took to Twitter to announce their dissatisfaction. After the news of the tainted lipsticks went viral, Jaclyn‚Äôs former friend Jackie Ania announced that she was cutting ties with Jaclyn.</p><p>Ania had this to say on the matter, ‚ÄúTo be honest this year ya‚Äôll gonna to start noticing I‚Äôm cool on a LOT of influencers ü§íyou won‚Äôt have to ask why because I‚Äôll always keep it cordial/professional. I‚Äôm also not going to paint all with a bad brush because it‚Äôs not fair & there‚Äôs still a lot of good in this industry."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jackie-ania-and-jeffree-star><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Jackie Ania and Jeffree Star</span></h2><p>When Jeffree Star made the decision to pose with his hair in cornrows to promote his Blood Lust cosmetics line, fans were quick to call him out for cultural appropriation. Jackie Ania used her platform to denounce Jeffree for this move and bring to light his past racism, "I have not and will not excuse his blatantly racist behavior," Jackie wrote about Jeffree. "Not his past references to me in derogatory terms, his continued use of the N-word, nor his efforts to eliminate spaces and opportunities for people of color."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Has Immature YouTube Sensation Logan Paul Finally Grown Up?</a></span></p><p>This wasn‚Äôt the first time Jackie had spoken out again Jeffree‚Äôs racism and she continues to be a powerful voice in the fight against racism.</p><h2 id=jeffree-star-jacklyn-hill-and-kathleenlights><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Jeffree Star, Jacklyn Hill, and KathleenLights</span></h2><p>In 2017, Jaclyn Hill posted a series of drunk videos to her Instagram of her and beauty influencer KathleenLights. The two can be seen playing a VR video game when Kathleen suddenly uses the n-word in response to something happening in the game.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kathleen can then be heard telling Jaclyn not to post the video which of course Jaclyn ended up doing. Always one to stir the pot, Jeffree Star took to Twitter to ask, ‚ÄúIf you ask someone not to post something and they still do‚Ä¶ What are the intentions?‚Äù. The tweet was deleted shortly after the feud.</p><h2 id=jeffree-star-and-laura-lee><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Jeffree Star and Laura Lee</span></h2><p>The feud between <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeffree Star</a> and fellow beauty-tuber Laura Lee was one of the first major beauty guru scandals to hit the mainstream. Back in 2017, the feud kicked off when Jeffree threw shade at Lee via twitter calling the<a href=#> beauty community</a> ‚Äúan ugly place full of ugly people.‚Äù In Shane Dawson‚Äôs first documentary on Star, the makeup mogul explained his side of the altercation when he implied that Laura and Manny MUA had used him for his connections and turned their backs on him by joining forces with rival <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Youtuber</a> Gabriel Zamora.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shortly after the documentary‚Äôs premiere, Lee, Manny, Zamora, and Nikita Dragon posted a comeback picture to Twitter with the caption, ‚ÄúB*tch is bitter because without him we're doing better." When fans caught on that the group‚Äôs photo was directed at Jeffree, a slew of attacks were hurled at the group. After Zamora responded by implying Jeffree was a racist, fans were quick to dig up old racist tweets from every member of Laura Lee‚Äôs crew‚Äôs past.</p><h2 id=manny-mua-and-gabriel-zamora><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Manny MUA and Gabriel Zamora</span></h2><p>"Dramageddon" part 2. After past tweets came to light pinning Gabriel Zamora, Manny MUA, and Laura Lee as racists, Zamora posted an apology video to YouTube in which he said his decision to post his infamous group photo was made after hearing rumors about Star‚Äôs alleged treatment of Manny and Laura Lee.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Emma Chamberlain's Net Worth & 9 More Fun Facts About The YouTuber</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Zamora claimed that he had since spoken to Star via phone and apologized for his share of the <a href=#>drama</a>. The two soon made amends and Zamora publicly denounced his former friendship with Manny.</p><h2 id=jeffree-star-and-manny-mua><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jeffree Star and Manny MUA</span></h2><p>The famous feud between Jeffree Star and Manny MUA is the final chapter of "Dramageddon". Shortly after Gabriel Zamora‚Äôs apology video, Manny uploaded his own&nbsp;<a href=#>apology</a> entitled, "My reality check". Manny apologized to the entire gang and stated that he wished he could go back in time and patch up his relationship with Star. "I didn't want Jeffree to get hurt or feel bullied in any way shape or form. Jeffree has done so much for me in my life. I would not be where I am today without Jeffree.‚Äù said a grief-stricken Manny.</p><p>Despite Manny‚Äôs sincerity, Jeffree turned down the apology by re-tweeting a not-so-nice message from a fan and saying, ‚ÄúThis sums up my thoughts on his apology video. Now please stop asking me about it, I‚Äôm busy being happy lol &lt;3.‚Äù</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jeffree-star-and-nikkietutorials><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Jeffree Star and NikkieTutorials</span></h2><p>While no one truly knows why Nikkie and Jeffree ended their friendship, the most popular rumor is that the pair‚Äôs relationship ended via a blowout on a <a href=#>yacht</a>. Star wasn‚Äôt shy about publicly criticizing Nikkie for her preserved missteps, including her failure to callout Tarte for the lack of diversity in their Shape Tape shade range.</p><p>This rivalry might have a happy ending yet, as it seems like the duo may have put their disagreements to the side. Jeffree took to Twitter to praise Nikkie for her Grinch inspired makeup tutorial, and came to Nikkie‚Äôs defense when the two posted very similar videos only a few days apart. Most recently, Star expressed his congratulations after Nikkie posted her famous video coming out as a transgender woman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=james-charles-jeffree-star-and-tati-westbrook><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>James Charles, Jeffree Star, and Tati Westbrook</span></h2><p>The feud to end all feuds. The tea kicked off when Tati uploaded a video accusing Charles of predatory sexual behavior after he hit on a straight waiter during Tati‚Äôs birthday dinner. Tati allegedly uploaded the video in retaliation for James promoting her competitor, Sugar Bear Hair on his Instagram. Not long after, Star jumped into the feud calling James a <a href=#>predator</a> and a ‚Äú<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">danger to society.</a>‚Äù</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Fitness YouTubers With Their Own Athletic Clothing Line Worth Buying</a></span></p><p>Charles lost millions of subscribers in a matter of days and it seemed like the teen‚Äôs career in the makeup industry might be over. A number of videos emerged coming to James‚Äô defense, including a video from the waiter mentioned in Tati‚Äôs original video. Charles uploaded a video explaining his side of the story complete with a number of receipts, and it soon became clear that Tati and Jeffree had been less than <a href=#>truthful</a> about the situation. Star and Tati issued their own apology videos, however, neither was received well by fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shane-dawson-and-tati-westbrook><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Shane Dawson and Tati Westbrook</span></h2><p>After fans began holding Shane‚Äôs feet to the fire over racist and pedophilic jokes, Tati‚Äôs video explaining her side of "Dramageddon" made Shane‚Äôs situation even worse. Tati claimed that Shane knew her about her original ‚ÄúBye Sister‚Äù video before it was posted and accused Shane and Jeffree Star of alerting news outlets to the upcoming drama.</p><p>Tati went on to say that Shane encouraged her to post the video despite Tati‚Äôs fears for James‚Äô wellbeing. Shane‚Äôs fans were shocked at the allegations and many took to Twitter to express feelings of betrayal.</p><h2 id=shane-dawson-and-jeffree-star><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Shane Dawson and Jeffree Star</span></h2><p>In the aftermath of Tati‚Äôs video, Shane posted a livestream where he was quite obviously in distress and indicated that Tati had crafted some of the arguments in her video. While Shane‚Äôs downward spiral was being documented for all to see, Jeffree seemed to disappear into thin air.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Jeffree has not actually stated that he and Shane are no longer friends, his silence in the wake of this new "Dramageddon" is telling. Jeffree was most recently seen buying a luxury car in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">now-viral video</a> but has yet to comment on the current drama.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Everything We Know About YouTube Star David Dobrik</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiwqK2kqq%2BmecGemK6sqWK6orfErqdmmqKarqzBz6xm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./a-peek-inside-sylvester-stallone-s-magnificent-watch-collection.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Peek Inside Sylvester Stallones Magnificent Watch Collection">&larr;
