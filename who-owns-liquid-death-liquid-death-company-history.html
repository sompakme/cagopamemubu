Let’s take a closer look at the company’s history and ownership.</p><p>Liquid Death was founded by Mike Cessario, a graphic designer and marketing professional. Inspired by concertgoers drinking water out of Monster Energy cans at a music festival, Cessario saw an opportunity to create a water brand with unconventional branding. In 2019, Liquid Death was officially introduced to the market.</p><p>The brand quickly gained recognition for its edgy tagline, “Murder Your Thirst,” and its distinctive packaging. The water is meticulously sourced and canned to perfection. As of 2023, the water is now canned by Wilderness Asset Holdings LLC in Virginia, USA.</p><p>Despite being a relatively young company, Liquid Death has already made significant waves in the beverage industry. The brand offers a range of products, including sparkling water and flavored carbonated beverages, to cater to various consumer preferences.</p><p>Over the years, Liquid Death has received substantial investments that have contributed to its growth and success. Science Inc., a prominent venture capital firm, and Live Nation Entertainment, a leading entertainment company, have both shown confidence in the brand. This has helped Liquid Death achieve a valuation of $700 million as of October 2022.</p><p>With a commitment to sustainability, Liquid Death promotes the use of aluminum cans to reduce plastic waste. The brand also donates a portion of its proceeds to initiatives aimed at combating plastic pollution, reflecting its dedication to making a positive impact.</p><h3>Key Takeaways:</h3><ul><li>Liquid Death is a canned water brand founded by Mike Cessario.</li><li>The company’s tagline is “Murder Your Thirst,” and it was introduced in 2019.</li><li>Liquid Death is currently canned by Wilderness Asset Holdings LLC in Virginia, USA.</li><li>The brand offers a range of products, including sparkling water and flavored carbonated beverages.</li><li>Liquid Death has received significant investments, leading to a valuation of $700 million.</li><li>The brand is committed to sustainability and donates a portion of its proceeds to combat plastic pollution.</li></ul><h2>The Origins of Liquid Death</h2><p>Liquid Death, a unique and unconventional bottled water brand, was founded by Mike Cessario, a graphic designer and marketing professional.

This observation sparked his creativity and led him to envision a brand that would challenge the norms of the bottled water industry and engage consumers in a distinct way.</p><p>Driven by his passion for innovation and humor, Cessario capitalized on this opportunity and embarked on the creation of Liquid Death. Finally, in 2019, the brand officially made its debut after securing seed funding from Science Inc., a prominent venture capital firm.
