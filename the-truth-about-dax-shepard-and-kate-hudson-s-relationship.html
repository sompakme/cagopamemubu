When we have a great first date, whether we swiped right on Tinder or met a friend of a friend at a party, we can't wait to tell our best pals. When actors meet at a party and begin dating, things play out in a much more dramatic and chaotic way. No matter how hard they try to keep their romance a secret, they get photographed holding hands, cuddling, or grabbing a latte (and we can at least relate to their love of coffee).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of all the celebrity couples, fans love <a href=#>Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard's relationship</a>. It's adorable to learn that Dax has a <a href=#>tattoo in place of a wedding ring</a> and we can't get enough of this sweet love story. It might be surprising to hear that Dax dated another famous star before falling madly in love with Kristen Bell, and it's even juicier to learn who it was. Let's take a look at the truth about Dax Shepard and Kate Hudson's relationship.</p><h2 id=dax-and-kate-39-s-love-story>Dax And Kate's Love Story</h2><p>As soon as we learned that Dax Shepard and Kate Hudson once dated, a big question was on our minds: what went wrong? Why aren't they still together?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">actors discussed their past romance</a> on Dax's podcast, Armchair Expert, and according to Dax, it was tough for him to deal with how well Kate Hudson's movie career was going. He was having trouble getting cast in movies, and here he was, dating someone who was a total movie star. Dax was super vulnerable and honest when talking about his feelings back then, and fans appreciated that he revealed so many personal details. The actor said, "I'm following this person around as they do things I wish I were doing.' It was just a rough period for me anyways. Then I felt all kinds of inadequacy in that position."</p><p>According to Us Weekly, the stars dated in 2007. It's definitely interesting to compare their careers up until this point. After playing Tom in the 2004 film Without A Paddle, Dax was cast as Vince in 2006's Employee Of The Month. He played a Field Agent in several episodes of Punk'd, but it wasn't until 2008 when he was cast in Baby Mama that fans can see Dax becoming more successful. He was cast in When In Rome, This Is Where I Leave You, and in 2010, became playing Crosby Braverman on the sweet, emotional TV drama Parenthood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kate Hudson, on the other hand, got her big break playing Penny Lane in the beloved 2000 movie Almost Famous. The actress became even more famous for her role as Andie in the romantic comedy How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days, and more film roles followed, from 2004's Raising Helen to The Skeleton Key (2005) and You, Me, And Dupree (2006).</p><p>It must be tough for actors to date each other sometimes, as you're always going to play the comparison game. It totally makes sense that Dax would have felt badly about not being as successful as he wanted to be at that point in time. Fans always love his ability to be completely honest.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About Howard Stern's Relationship With Kristen Bell And Dax Shepard</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When people break up, they often say that they wanted different things, and that was the case with this relationship, too. Kate Hudson said being in "different places" is what made them split up, but they were "super compatible" while they were together.</p><p>The actors first met at a party that Toby Maguire threw at his home, and they were together for three months.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About Kate Hudson's Relationship With Her Father</a></span></p><p>Even though Dax Shepard and Kate Hudson were only together for three months, it sounds like Kate had a great influence on Dax, and might have even helped him be better in relationships so he could fall in love with Kristen Bell.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actor shared on his podcast that he hadn't been monogamous before dating Kate and that she showed him what good communication was. He said, "I literally learned how to say, ‘When you do this, I'm scared and I feel this way.'"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Do Dax Shepard And Kristen Bell Fight In Front Of Their Kids?</a></span></p><p>Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell have been a favorite famous couple since they tied the knot back in 2013. Even with the COVID-19 pandemic, the couple is still making us smile and helping us learn more about relationships, and it sounds like Dax learned a lot from dating Kate Hudson, which is fun to hear about.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Glamour.com, Kristen shared that she and Dax were going to therapy on their own, and this gave them time and space to discuss each other. The actress said, "He suggested we go to therapy separately, kinda, so that we could talk sh*t about each other. And we did, and it's been great. What we've been doing the last couple months is, every two weeks or so, I'll see Harry via Zoom and complain about Dax, and then he'll give me all the reasons why I'm wrong, and then Dax will do the same. And then, by the time we meet up in the evening, we love each other again because our toolboxes are bigger.”</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>How Kristen Bell And Dax Shepard Spend Their Combined $40 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6pa3XZqqhnaCWv6V5wKebZqORqbJutNSdqqimo2K%2FprjAraCopqOdtrF7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./top-10-greatest-nfl-rivalries-of-all-time.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Top 10 Greatest NFL Rivalries of ALL Time">&larr;
