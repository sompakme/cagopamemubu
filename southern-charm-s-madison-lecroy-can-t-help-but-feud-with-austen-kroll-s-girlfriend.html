Sadly, for a long time, the same thing could be said when it comes to “reality” TV. Thanks to Bravo’s Southern Charm which has been on the air since 2014, anyone who wants to see “reality” TV with a southern flair has the perfect show to watch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Craig's Business Outside Of Southern Charm</a></span></p><p>Of course, there is a lot more to like about Southern Charm than the fact that the show is shot in the South. After all, just like a lot of other hit “reality” shows that are on the air today, <a href=#>Southern Charm focuses on some rich socialites</a> who have lives that are full of drama and gossip. For example, a lot of Southern Charm stars have dated during the show and sadly, couples like <a href=#>Kathryn Dennis And Chleb Ravenell have gone their separate ways</a>. Similarly, after dating for almost three years, Madison LeCroy and Austen Kroll split up at the end of 2020. Since then, Kroll has got a new girlfriend and as it turned out, LeCroy seemingly couldn’t resist throwing some shade in his new love interest’s direction.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-madison-lecroy-and-olivia-flowers-rsquo-feud-began>How Madison LeCroy And Olivia Flowers’ Feud Began</h2><p>Once a couple has been together for a while, it is only natural for them to begin blending their lives to a certain degree. On top of that, depending on what the members of the couple want out of life, after a year or two, it makes sense to potentially begin making big plans for the future. As a result, when a couple breaks up after reaching that kind of level in their relationship, it can be exceedingly hard for both people involved to accept that things have ended. With that in mind, it makes perfect sense that so many couples break up and make up over and over in hopes of eventually making things work.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Most Famous On Again Off Again Relationships In Hollywood</a></span></p><p>On top of some couples reacting to a difficult break up by getting back together, it is common for some people to want to lash out at their ex following a split. Fortunately, it can be easier to get over those kinds of emotions if you manage to make a clean break from your ex. When it comes to “reality” stars like Madison LeCroy and Austen Kroll, however, avoiding each other completely is nearly impossible since they continue to star in the same show. Worse yet, Kroll’s new girlfriend Olivia Flowers has joined the cast of Southern Charm as of season eight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it was announced that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Olivia Flowers was going to be a part of Southern Charm’s eighth season</a>, everyone thought it was only a matter of time before things came to a head with Madison LeCroy. Still, it amazed most onlookers that after the debut episode from the eighth season aired, LeCroy and Flowers began taking shots at each other. However, given the fact that <a href=#>LeCroy often seems to be a controversy magnet</a>, maybe it was ridiculous that anyone was surprised by what happened next.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=austen-froll-rsquo-s-new-girlfriend-olivia-flowers-took-major-shots>Austen Froll’s New Girlfriend Olivia Flowers Took Major Shots</h2><p>During the first episode of Southern Charm’s eighth season, Austen Kroll’s new girlfriend Olivia Flowers referred to his ex, Madison LeCroy as “homegirl”. Clearly not pleased by that, Lecroy decided to respond to Flowers’ remark by posting an image of herself on Instagram with the caption “I’d rather be a homegirl than a homely girl 😎”.</p><p>Of course, it is legitimate for Madison LeCroy to dislike Olivia Flowers for any reason she may want including the fact that she is dating Austen Kroll. That said, many people still considered LeCroy’s response to Flowers to be ridiculous. After all, anyone claiming that Flowers is “homely” has truly ridiculous beauty standards. As a result, it isn’t surprising that one of the top responses to LeCroy’s post consisted of only one word, “petty”.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>6 Exciting Moments To Expect In Season 8 Of 'Southern Charm'</a></span></p><p>Despite the way a lot of onlookers responded to Madison LeCroy’s Instagram post, Olivia Flowers opted to post a retort as well in the form of in an Instagram story. Alongside a photo of herself lounging in a house coat and about to eat Doritos, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Flowers wrote the words “Homely? More like Homebody?”</a> Unsurprisingly, as was the case with LeCroy’s post, many people called Flowers out and sided with Madison.</p><p>As of the time of this writing, there is every reason to believe that Olivia Flowers and Madison LeCroy’s feud will continue for the immediate future at the very least. After all, even when Austen Kroll and LeCroy are both in relationships that seemingly make them happy, that doesn’t put an end to the drama. In fact, at this point, it seems like the bad blood that exists between LeCroy, Flowers, and Kroll is going to survive for a long time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, for all of their sakes, it would be nice if they could put all the drama behind them. However, that wouldn’t make for great TV so Southern Charm’s producers likely are happy with how things are now.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>How Much Is ‘Southern Charm’ Star Madison LeCroy Worth?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqqK2knbKzuoycn5qqnah6rq3Doqqopl2hsqS%2BzrJkn52lmXqiwdKtnKdlm6e8rbjSZp6iqpybv6qxzZ1m</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-mika-kleinschmidt-parents-ethnicity-religion-and-family-background.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Is Mika Kleinschmidt Parents Ethnicity?
