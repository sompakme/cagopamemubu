Of course,<a href=#> Selena Gomez</a> and Justin Bieber yearned for each other's company for a significant period. Their relationship was marked by an on-again/off-again dynamic, which captured the public's attention and became one of the most talked-about pop culture romances. From 2011 to 2015, both artists penned numerous songs about their connection, even after their breakup. Gomez served as a significant inspiration for many tracks on Bieber's albums Believe, Journals, and Purpose.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Taylor Swift, Selena Gomez, and Justin Bieber Share More Than Just Singing Voices: Their Faces Hurt Too (Just Like Us).</a></span></p><p>However, since tying the knot with Hailey Baldwin Bieber, the 29-year-old singer has found a new source of inspiration.

However, it was during the turbulent times of their breakup that the singer’s relationship greatly influenced the entire album.

Among its tracks, "Heartbreaker" stood out, featuring poignant lyrics. The song reached its peak at number 13 on the US Billboard Hot 100, spending a total of two weeks on the chart. According to Marie Claire, Bieber openly shared the inspiration behind the song on Twitter, "It's a song for people going through heartbreak — like I was when I wrote it. It means so much to me to be able to share what I was, and am still going through, with my fans."</p><h2 id=justin-bieber-39-s-quot-all-that-matters-quot-was-inspired-by-selena-gomez><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Justin Bieber's "All That Matters" Was Inspired By Selena Gomez</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/justin-bieber-and-selena-gomez-paparazzi-photo.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bieber expressed his fondness for the joyful moments he shared with Gomez in his track, "All That Matters." The song achieved considerable success and undoubtedly revolved around Gomez.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In a radio interview</a>, Bieber not only confirmed that the song was entirely about Gomez, but he also revealed that he wrote it during a period when they were still together and their relationship was thriving. He explained, "'All That Matters' was written when I was in a great place in my relationship. At that time, she was all that mattered.” When directly asked if the song was about Gomez, Bieber openly acknowledged, "I created my best music when my heart was broken."</p><h2 id=justin-bieber-39-s-quot-sorry-quot-is-about-his-regret-for-not-winning-back-selena-gomez><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Justin Bieber's "Sorry" Is About His Regret For Not Winning Back Selena Gomez</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Selena-Gomez-And-Justin-Bieber-Said-Some-Truly-Awful-Things-About-Each-Other.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Bieber released "Sorry" in 2015, it immediately sparked speculation among fans whether it served as an apology to his former flame. The song undeniably conveyed Bieber's emotions and remorse over the definitive end of their relationship. Despite subsequent attempts to rekindle their connection and the lingering drama that persisted well into the following decade, this song felt like one of those heartfelt apology tracks aimed at winning back Gomez.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Did Justin Bieber's Ramsay Hunt Syndrome Issues Start?</a></span></p><p>During an appearance on Ellen DeGeneres' show in November 2015, Bieber confirmed that "Sorry" was indeed about Gomez.
