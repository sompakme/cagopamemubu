Love knows no boundaries as age is just a number, and these two prove it as they have finally revealed themselves to the public.</p><p>We hope they both have a happy ending and find the love of their life, whether it is each other or not. It can't be denied though that these <a href=#>two are utterly adorable together</a>, so we hope that they do manage to last.</p><h2 id=she-is-an-ordained-minister>8.
