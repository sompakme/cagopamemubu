It wasn't too clear if Cyrus and Gomez were friends or had a feud going on with each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gomez was normally <a href=#>seen hanging out with her childhood best friend, Demi Lovato</a> rather than Cyrus. But so much time has passed since the two went on to do much more with their careers and fans got a little insight into how the two truly feel about each other.</p><h2 id=selena-gomez-and-miley-cyrus-39-days-on-disney-together>Selena Gomez And Miley Cyrus' Days On Disney Together</h2><p>One of the main reasons why fans were sure the two didn't get along was because of Nick Jonas. Miley Cyrus and Nick Jonas dated from 2006 to 2008. Around 2009-2010, Selena Gomez started dating Jonas after he and Cyrus broke up. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gomez was even featured in the music video for the hit song, Burnin Up by The Jonas Brothers</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Is Why Selena Gomez Wants To Quit Music</a></span></p><p>But after Gomez and Jonas also broke up it seemed like Cyrus could relate to how Gomez was feeling. During Cyrus' performance of her song, 7 Things at the Teen Choice Awards, she went up to Gomez and the two sang a line together. The song is confirmed to be about Jonas. Cyrus also posted a throwback of this video on her Instagram. Gomez commented, <a href=#>"TBT- such babies".</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cyrus and Gomez not only have that in common, but they also bond over their Disney Channel days. The two have practically grown up with each other in the same type of spotlight. <a href=#>Both Cyrus and Gomez are turning 30</a> in 2022, so while it was clear the two were not the best of friends during their Disney days, they have certainly decided to move past anything in the past and are totally cool with each other now.</p><h2 id=selena-gomez-brings-miley-cyrus-up-on-snl-episode>Selena Gomez Brings Miley Cyrus Up On SNL Episode</h2><p>Gomez hosted Saturday Night Live and actually brought Miley Cyrus up during her opening monologue. She started by mentioning that she had asked some of her famous friends for advice on hosting the show. Then she reveals she asked fellow Disney star, Miley Cyrus as well. She refers to Cyrus as one of her oldest friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Twitter Cannot Handle The Nostalgia Of Selena Gomez And Vanessa Hudgens Reuniting</a></span></p><p>In a Miley Cyrus voice, Gomez told the audience what advice Cyrus gave her. She said, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Just be yourself and have fun".</a> In a pretty spot-on impression of Cyrus' voice. Not only was it nice for fans to hear Gomez talk about Cyrus and make a spot-on impression, but she also solidified that the two are actually friends.</p><p>Gomez also revealed what she said to Cyrus after she gave her advice for the show. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Is that just an excuse for me to imitate you on the show?"</a> Gomez said to which Cyrus replied, "Hell yeah, I'm Miley Cyrus." It seems the two are pretty close friends and are able to just call each other up whenever. This made a lot of Hannah Montana and Wizards of Waverly Place fans reminisce on the twos' Disney's days.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-miley-cyrus-react-to-selena-39-s-impression-of-her>How Did Miley Cyrus React To Selena's Impression Of Her?</h2><p>After seeing Gomez talk about Cyrus on Saturday Night Live, fans were curious to know what Cyrus thought about the impression. Cyrus posted a picture of herself on Twitter, wearing a shirt that reads "Hell yeah, I'm Miley Cyrus". Directly quoting what Gomez said, she also tagged both Gomez and SNL in the post.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Miley Cyrus Brings On The Nostalgia By Singing Her Old Songs For Fans</a></span></p><p>She also reposted the video of Gomez's impression on her Twitter. It's pretty safe to approve that Cyrus approves of how well Gomez impersonated her. This interaction between the two certainly solidified their friendship to their fans. It seems they not only got over all of the things from the past but they have also chosen to keep in touch and become pretty close friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two have ad such successful careers since their Disney Channel days. Both have gone on to make music. Gomez has starred in quite a lot of television shows and movies. Cyrus has also starred in some movies and television shows.</p><p>Cyrus is currently on tour and Gomez is starring in a show alongside Steve Martin. Hopefully, fans will get to see more of their friendship in the future. But for now they can watch Gomez' spot-on impression of her long-time friend.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Does Miley Cyrus Have The Highest Net Worth Of All Disney Channel Stars?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dqLKtsc2aZKCnnZrHbrnIpZyyZZOuv7a%2FjKyroqScYrOztcSnm6xllJ7Ar7HYaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tamberla-perry-height-net-worth-age-who-facts-biography-wiki.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tamberla Perry Height, Net Worth, Age, Who, Facts, Biography, Wiki">&larr;
