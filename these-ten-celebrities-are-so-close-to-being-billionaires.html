With<strong> $650 million</strong> in the bank, the long-time radio host is just about<strong> ready to crack into the billionaire’s lounge</strong>, so to speak. The Private Parts star has used controversy and shock jock tactics to ensure that when he puts his head on the pillow, it’s most likely with the knowledge that the elusive billionaire status is right around the corner. Pleasant dreams, Howard.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kristen Bell's Reported Net Worth Is $20 Million: How Did She Earn Her Wealth?</a></span></p><h2 id=bono-700-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Bono ($700 Million)</span></h2><p>Paul David Hewson, Bono Vox, and then finally just <strong>Bono </strong>is a wealthy lad. The Irish rock legend is worth a cool<strong> $700 million and growing. Poised to become a billionaire</strong>, the “Discotheque” singer has made his fortune with major hit albums, world tours, entering the hotel business, as well as being on the board of a private equity called Elevation Partners. With the entrepreneurial spirit (not to mention a kind spirit, which was on full display <a href=#>when he released his first song in three years dedicated to the people of Italy</a>), Bono will likely see a billion sooner rather than later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> Is Jenna Marbles Still Worth $8 Million?

The House of Payne star has stated that his constant working for more than 20 years has paid off. Mr. Perry seems to have a knack for not only making hit movies, but also understatements.</p><h2 id=ivanka-trump-800-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Ivanka Trump ($800 Million)</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The former President’s daughter, <strong>Ivanka,</strong> was born into the wealthy Trump family. However, Trump has generated her own fortune, amassing a net worth of<strong> $800 million</strong>,<strong> just short of the coveted billion dollars. </strong>Through modeling, a line of handbags and footwear, her own jewelry company, and a series of other economic ventures, Ivanka has money for days. With a line of women's workwear which quickly hit $100 million in annual revenue, Trump seems like she will be a billion in no time. Side note: the combined wealth of both Trump and her husband Jared Kushner reaches a billion dollars. <a href=#>How did they accomplish that?</a></p><h2 id=celine-dion-800-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Celine Dion ($800 Million)</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Celine Dion </strong>has been belting powerful ballets and soothing melodies into the ears of her fans for more than 20 years.

With a net worth of<strong> $850 million, Madonna is very close to amassing a billion dollar </strong>fortune. The “Rain” singer has been generating a vast fortune since the mid-80s with constant hit albums and controversial image. Madonna has also ventured into the world of investment such as real estate, purchasing $80 million worth of real estate, as well as investing in an art collection worth $100 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dr-dre-820-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Dr. Dre ($820 Million)</span></h2><p><strong>Dr. Dre's net worth of $820 million </strong>is impressive, to say the least. The hip hop pioneer has been adding to that net worth (which is<strong> almost at a billion dollars</strong>) since the late 80s. Dre can thank his hit albums as a solo artist, his stint with N.W.A., producing work, and other ventures for his vast fortune.
