After a rocky journey from the blind experiment and into a shared apartment, the latter skipped her wedding gown fittings to meet a former pod flame, Josh Demas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Marshall learned about it right at his own tux fittings when his co-star, Brett Brown informed him that his now-wife, Tiffany Pennywell had texted him about it. When Marshall got home, Jackie was there, ready to discuss what had happened.</p><p>"I knew as soon as we came back from Mexico and we started living together that it wasn't gonna work out between me and Marshall," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she later told Us Weekly</a>. Leading up to the split, Marshall had opened up in a confessional interview that Jackie wanted him to be more "aggressive."</p><p>While talking about the future of their relationship, Marshall calmly handled an emotional Jackie and politely asked her to return the engagement ring. However, she refused.</p><p>During the reunion, Marshall explained why he wanted the ring back. The year-old couple, Jackie and Josh had also given an update on the ring during a day-earlier Zoom chat with <a href=#>"biased" show host, Vanessa Lachey</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Did The Internet Think Love Is Blind's Kwame Appiah Hired 'A Random Ghanaian Woman' To Play His Sister?</a></span></p><h2 id=why-did-love-is-blind-39-s-marshall-want-the-ring-back-from-jackie>Why Did Love Is Blind's Marshall Want The Ring Back From Jackie?</h2><p>During her pre-recorded interview alongside Josh, Jackie claimed that Marshall "wanted the ring back because he wanted to propose to another castmate." He then admitted that cast member, Kacia Clark had reached out to him after hearing about his split from Jackie.</p><p>"Kacia sent me a very beautiful voice message the day that me and Jackie broke up," Marshall confessed during the reunion. However, he denied wanting to propose to her. "I did not want to propose to anybody else," he said. "That wasn't the case, and that's really wild she would think that, because she was the only person I was worrying about in the pods."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ft4hu2wwwaeau93.jpeg><p>Later on, he told E! News that he "tried" to make it work with Kacia but it turned out to be like his previous relationship. "I wanted to just distance myself from all of that, from that experience," he said. "It was going to be difficult to try to make a relationship with Kacia." He added that the breakup was "rough" and that he was "apologetic about starting something" at that time.</p><p>On the reunion episode, Marshall also set the record straight on why he wanted the ring back. "It was a symbol of my love," he explained, to which the audience applauded. "You know, we picked out those rings, and in that moment I looked at that ring and I said, 'That's for her.' And I felt like she didn't deserve to have that symbol of my love."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During their final talk, after Jackie had decided to keep the ring, Marshall told her: "Every time you look at that thing, whatever you do with it, I want you to be reminded that you passed up on something great."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Deepti's Romance With Love Is Blind's Kyle Abrams May Have Made Her Lose All Faith In Men</a></span></p><h2 id=does-love-is-blind-39-s-jackie-still-have-marshall-39-s-ring-now-that-she-39-s-with-josh>Does Love Is Blind's Jackie Still Have Marshall's Ring Now That She's With Josh?</h2><p>During the pre-taped video, Jackie revealed that she still had the ring with her. She also clarified that she didn't cheat on Marshall. "Okay, so I broke up with Marshall before I saw Josh at the coffee shop. It looks like I'm a cheater and I am not a cheater," she said.</p><p>She noted that they broke up "off-camera when we were filling out the marriage certificate," adding that Marshall "had called me a derogatory name and we fought about it and he left for three days. I think what it was was it was a bad joke. It was one of those where we were joking, but it just came off as bad."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ft4ejdix0aeqsq8.jpeg><p>Marshall admitted to telling Jackie: "You got a strong jawline. I mean, like, you could've been a man for all I know." In his defense, he claimed that it was only a response to Jackie teasing him about being "sweet" — referring to Marshall's emotional openness, which Josh labeled as "touchy." It was also a distasteful subject in a leaked group text with Jackie's friends.</p><p>Speaking to Us, the Baltimore native said that although he was "100 percent blindsided" by Jackie and Josh's romance: "I don't have any ill will towards Jackie or Josh. We shared that experience for quite some time, and I'll always have that to remember, and I am choosing to hold on to the good memories and let go of the hurtful ones and the one that ultimately ended us."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Love Is Blind Season 4: What Micah And Irina Have Said About Being The 'Mean Girls'</a></span></p><h2 id=who-pays-for-the-rings-on-love-is-blind>Who Pays For The Rings On Love Is Blind?</h2><p>In an Instagram statement, Jackie claimed that "as for the ring, Marshall did not pay for the ring Love Is Blind paid for all the rings." Series creator, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Coelen told Entertainment Tonight</a>: "Since they were in the facility and weren't able to go out into the 'real world' at that point, they couldn't have been able to go [to a shop]."</p><p>"We wouldn't have allowed them to at that point," he continued. "It's obviously such a gigantic moment in people's lives that we wanted it to be as authentic to them as it possibly could be."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ft5llkjaqaavwpl.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The show pays for the ring if it's picked out from the Love Is Blind collection. However, Coelen said that contestants are free to elevate it. "If they wanted to spend their own money, or try to enhance it within reason, we would certainly allow that," he stated.</p><p>"We would never put any constraints on them unless it was something we couldn't accommodate within the show," he noted. "That was really up to them." However, it wasn't disclosed whether Marshall paid for custom upgrades on the ring or not.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddpa6qsIyfpqtlmpawrLXEZpinnF2irrO%2Fx5qjpatdp7avs4yopWakn6uybrXSZpmloZ6ZfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./james-l-brooks-net-worth-how-much-is-james-l-brooks-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="James L Brooks Net Worth  How Much is James L Brooks Worth?">&larr;
