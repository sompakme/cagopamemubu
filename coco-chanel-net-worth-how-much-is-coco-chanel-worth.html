She had a challenging childhood, with her parents working in menial jobs to make ends meet. Tragically, Chanel’s mother passed away when she was just 11 years old, leaving her and her siblings in a vulnerable position.</p><p>Due to their circumstances, Chanel and her siblings were sent to an orphanage, where she learned important skills that would later shape her career. It was during her time at the orphanage that Chanel developed a passion for sewing. Her skills flourished, and she quickly became adept at creating clothing and accessories.</p><p>After leaving the orphanage, Chanel lived in a boarding house for Catholic girls. It was here that she began her career as a seamstress, honing her craft and gaining invaluable experience in the world of fashion.</p><h2>Chanel Founding</h2><p>Coco Chanel embarked on her journey as a fashion designer by venturing into hat design while residing with her lover, Étienne Balsan. Her talent and creativity caught the attention of the theatre world when renowned actress Gabrielle Dorziat showcased Chanel’s hats in a play, propelling Chanel into the spotlight.</p><p>In 1910, Chanel further solidified her position in the fashion industry by becoming a licensed milliner. She established her boutique, <b>Chanel Modes</b>, in the fashion capital of Paris, thereby laying the foundation for her eponymous fashion brand that would revolutionize women’s fashion.</p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Milestone</th></tr><tr><td>1910</td><td>Chanel becomes a licensed milliner and opens <b>Chanel Modes</b> boutique in Paris</td></tr><tr><td>1913</td><td>Chanel expands her business with a boutique in Deauville</td></tr><tr><td>1915</td><td>Chanel opens another successful location in Biarritz</td></tr></table><p>Chanel’s boutique in Paris became a hub for fashion-forward individuals seeking unique and stylish designs.

Under this partnership, Wertheimer acquired a majority stake in the company while Chanel retained a smaller ownership percentage. The details of the deal stipulated that Wertheimer would own a significant 70% of the brand, while Chanel would hold a mere 10%.</p><p>This collaboration with Wertheimer allowed Chanel to establish Parfums Chanel, a subsidiary dedicated to producing and marketing Chanel fragrances. The partnership was instrumental in expanding the reach of Chanel’s signature scents and contributed to the company’s overall success.</p><p>Although the deal initially proved fruitful, disputes later arose regarding brand control and ownership. Despite the challenges, the Wertheimer family’s influence and ownership of Chanel have endured over the years.</p><p>Today, Chanel remains under the ownership of the Wertheimer family, ensuring the brand’s continued success and perpetuation of Chanel’s vision. Alain and Gerard Wertheimer, the sons of <b>Pierre Wertheimer</b>, now hold the reins of the iconic fashion house. Their combined net worth is estimated to be between $90 and $100 billion.</p><p>Through this enduring partnership, Chanel has thrived and solidified its status as one of the world’s most prestigious and influential fashion brands.</p><h2>1930s Onward</h2><p>By the late 1930s, Chanel had firmly established herself as one of the most influential designers in Paris, propelling the Chanel brand to unprecedented heights of success. Her innovative fashion line captivated the world with its timeless elegance and effortless sophistication.
