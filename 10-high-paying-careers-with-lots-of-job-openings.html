Let’s address the salary requirements first. The median annual wage for U.S. workers is $34,750, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. However, the lowest paying job on this list has a median annual wage of $60,300.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But a high-paying salary won’t matter if you can’t find a job, but you can increase your chances of gainful employment when you choose a profession that has a lot of job openings. There’s no guarantee that you’ll land a job just because there are a lot of openings, but you’ll definitely increase your odds.</p><p>The professions that are experiencing high growth rates resulting in an abundance of new jobs tend to fall in one of four categories: healthcare, business, information technology, and education. Keep reaching to discover the professions with the most job openings that also pay an above-average salary.</p><h2 id=medical-and-health-services-managers-73-300-new-jobs>10. Medical and Health Services Managers: 73,300 New Jobs</h2><p>via:bigstockphoto.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Through the year 2022, the U.S. Department of Labor projects that there will be 73,300 new medical and health services managers in the country. As the U.S. population gets older, there will be an increased need for medical services - which are typically administered in medical facilities. Medical and health services managers, who are also known as healthcare executives or healthcare administrators, create work schedules, handle billing and fees, and ensure that the facility is compliant with regulations and laws. The educational requirement is usually a bachelor’s degree in health administration, although some managers have a master’s degree. The median annual wage for this profession is $88,580.</p><p></p><h2 id=physicians-and-surgeons-123-300-new-jobs>9. Physicians and Surgeons: 123,300 New Jobs</h2><p>via:bigstockphoto.com</p><p>The 123,300 new positions for physicians and surgeons that the Department of Labor predicts through 2022 are representative of the expansion of the Affordable Care Act and an aging population that will require more physicians and surgeons to examine and diagnose patients, order and interpret medical tests, and prescribe medications, in addition to the medical operations performed by surgeons. The educational requirements for these doctors are extensive. After receiving a bachelor’s degree, physicians and surgeons need four years of medical school, and anywhere from three to eight years of internships and residencies. The median annual wage for primary care physicians is $220,942. For physicians and surgeons in specialty practices, the median annual wage is $396,233.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=computer-systems-analysts-127-700-new-jobs>8. Computer Systems Analysts: 127,700 New Jobs</h2><p>via:bigstockphoto.com</p><p>Computer systems analysts are in high demand through 2022 because of the country’s -and the world’s - reliance on information technology. Advances in cloud computing, electronic medical records, and wireless and mobile networks mean that companies need individuals who can analyze information systems, and then recommend and design infrastructure upgrades to improve efficiency. While most computer systems analysts have a bachelor’s degree in a computer field, this is not necessarily a requirement. Computer programming or information technology skills are the most important factor. Computer systems analysts can expect to earn a median annual income of $79,680.</p><p></p><h2 id=market-research-analysts-131-500-new-jobs>7. Market Research Analysts: 131,500 New Jobs</h2><p>via:bigstockphoto.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are already 415,700 market research analysts, according to the Department of Labor, so the addition of 131,500 new positions through 2022 represents a significant increase. These professionals forecast trends in marketing and sales, create and assess the data gathered through surveys and questionnaires, and determine the effectiveness of marketing strategies. The growth in this area is driven by the need of companies to understand consumers and their buying trends. A bachelor’s degree in market research, math, or statistics is the usual requirement to enter this field. The median annual wage for marketing research analysts is $60,300.</p><p></p><h2 id=management-analysts-133-800-new-jobs>6. Management Analysts: 133,800 New Jobs</h2><p>via:bigstockphoto.com</p><p>Management analysts, also known as management consultants, help companies use their resources more efficiently. The Department of Labor predicts that demand for these professionals is driven by the expansion of U.S. businesses abroad and an increase in small, specialized firms that want to ensure that their policies, workers, and equipment are maximized to increase revenue and lower operating costs. A bachelor’s degree in one of several fields, including business, economics, management, marketing, psychology, computer science, or finance will satisfy the educational requirement for this career option. Management analysts earn a median annual wage of $78,600.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=accountants-166-700-new-jobs>5. Accountants: 166,700 New Jobs</h2><p>via:bigstockphoto.com</p><p>There are a lot of accountants in the country. By Department of Labor estimates, there are currently 1,275,400 number crunchers, but the Department predicts that 166,700 new accounting positions will be added through 2022. You can thank the many financial scandals for growth in this area. Tighter regulations, new laws, and more audits increase the need for professionals who can ensure that financial records are accurate and in compliance. Accountants also help companies operate more efficiently through cost-cutting measures. Most accountants have a bachelor’s degree in accounting or a closely related field. The median annual income for accountants is $63,550.</p><p></p><h2 id=software-developers-222-600-new-jobs>4. Software Developers: 222,600 New Jobs</h2><p>via:bigstockphoto.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is another profession that already has a lot of warm bodies. There are 1,018,000 software developers, but the Department of Labor predicts that 222,600 new positions are needed by 2022. Computer software demand is through the roof for everything from cell phones, appliances, cars, and other machines and devices. A bachelor’s degree in computer science is the usual requirement for this position. However, some applicants have a degree in software engineering or mathematics. Software developers can expect to receive a median annual salary of $93,350.</p><p></p><h2 id=postsecondary-teachers-236-400-new-jobs>3. Postsecondary Teachers: 236,400 New Jobs</h2><p>via:bigstockphoto.com</p><p>Although there are 1,267,300 post-secondary teachers, the Department of Labor estimates that by 2022, the country will need 236,400 more of them. Through 2022, a large number of students are projected to graduate from high school and attend colleges and universities. And if the government increases the amount of money spent on higher education and research, these numbers could climb even higher. Most post-secondary teachers who work at 4-year colleges and universities need a Ph.D. in their specialty area, although some schools will accept a master’s degree for part-time positions. Two-year colleges will usually accept a master’s degree as well. Post-secondary teachers earn a median annual wage of $68,970.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=general-and-operations-managers-244-100-new-jobs>2. General and Operations Managers: 244,100 New Jobs</h2><p>via:bigstockphoto.com/</p><p>The 224,100 new positions for general and operations managers reflect a growing optimism in the country’s economy, resulting in the birth of new companies in addition to businesses that will expand their operations through 2022. General and operations managers are needed to oversee staff, manage projects, and ensure that employees adhere to company policies and procedures. While a bachelor’s degree in a subject such as business administration is usually required, some industries, such as retail and transportation, may not require a degree. General and operations managers earn a median annual wage of $101,650.</p><p></p><h2 id=registered-nurses-526-800-new-jobs>1. Registered Nurses: 526,800 New Jobs</h2><p>via:bigstockphoto.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Department of Labor projects that there will be more than double the number of new registered nursing positions than new jobs for the career in 2nd place (general and operations managers). More Americans have health insurance and access to health care, and more elderly patients with chronic conditions such as arthritis and dementia, will need nurses to provide care. Also, more elderly patients will either be treated at home or in residential settings that require nursing services. Registered nurses can meet the profession’s educational requirement through one of three ways: they can obtain a nursing certificate, an associate’s degree, or a bachelors degree in nursing. The median annual wage for registered nurses in $65,470.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmm62jnrumv9JoaGllmJ60qXnPmrCippdisKK%2BxJ6prGWnnsGpecuoq6xln5t6q7vBZqapnZ6eu6i%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./15-strict-rules-the-kardashians-make-their-nannies-follow.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Strict Rules The Kardashians Make Their Nannies Follow">&larr;
