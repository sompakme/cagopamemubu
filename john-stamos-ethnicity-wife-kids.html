He grew up in a modest family with his 2 younger siblings. John Stamos hails from a mixed ethnic background of Greek, English, Irish, German and a bit of Jewish-Russian mix. As a young boy, he worked in his family food business (restaurant) in Orange County.</p><p>John Stamos was but a boy of 4 when his interest in music piqued, he was enrolled into a class where he was taught how to play drums and he later formed his own band called ‘Destiny’, they played in parties, amusement parks, and concerts. He later in 1994 released his first album titled ‘Shades of Blue’, the album was subsequently released on iTunes. He worked with Gary Griffin, Tony Guerrero, David Enos, Lanny Cordola among others.</p><p>The actor was educated at John F. Kennedy High School where he started honing his musical skills. At the age of 15, the lad was a part of an all-boys band where he played drums and vocals for them during tours and concerts. After high school, John was admitted to Cypress College but dropped out in just a semester to focus on building his career as an actor with his parent’s blessings. It was not long before he clinched his first TV show in General Hospital; the medical soap opera which ran from 1982 to 1984 earning him a Guinness record as the longest-running production as at that time.</p><p>From thereon, he had a wonderful acting career starring in various television shows like the sitcom ‘Full House’ which was aired from 1987 to 1995. Stamos got another lead role in the Medical TV Show ER&nbsp;where he assumed the role of Dr. Tony Gates from 2005 to 2009, he made a quick appearance in the season 12 of the crime series Law and Order: Special Victim Unit&nbsp;as Ken Turner in 2011, Bye Bye Birdie&nbsp;(2015- 2016) and films such as Never Too Young To Die&nbsp;(1986), My Man Is A Loser&nbsp;(2014) and My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2&nbsp;(2016) among many others.</p><p>He has also had the opportunity of producing films like the Netflix series of Fuller House&nbsp;a sequel of the Full House.</p><p>Moreover, the amiable actor has appeared in a few TV shows like Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel shows, he even performed (July 2017) and hosted the Capitol fourth (July 2018).</p><p>For his outstanding performance in the entertainment industry, he has been nominated severally for awards, a few of which he carted away such as the ‘Most Exciting New Actor’ Soapy award in 1982 for his role in General Hospital, the Outstanding Supporting actor Drama series by Young Artist Awards, 1984 and of course the People’s Choice Award in ‘Favorite Actor In A New TV series’ in ‘Grandfathered’ (2016).

He was seen kissing a fellow man in the film and his strong support for the LGBT community also heightened the rumors that the veteran actor was indeed gay but we know for a fact that he is not because of his various personal romantic relationships were with women two of which he married in the course of his relationships.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=john-stamos-girlfriend-or-wife-and-kids></span><strong>John Stamos’ Girlfriend Or&nbsp;</strong><strong>Wife&nbsp;</strong><strong>And Kids</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As earlier stated the actor has been romantically linked to several beauties in the entertainment industry some of the notable names are&nbsp;Teri Copley, Denise Richards, Denise Matthews, Demi Moore, Paula Abdul, Ingrid Sthare, Amy Poehler among others.</p><p>He has also signed the dotted lines of the marriage register twice, his first attempt at marriage was with the beautiful blond Actress and model&nbsp;Rebecca&nbsp;Romijn, a victorian secret model whom he met at one of their fashion events, the duo started dating in 1994 and by Eve of Christmas in 1997 they were engaged then the knot in September of the following year 1998 at the famous Beverly Hills Hotel.</p><ul>Unfortunately, their marriage was short-lived as the pair went their separate ways after John Stamos filed for divorce in August 2004, their divorce was finalized in March 2005.</ul><p>Luckily for John Stamos, he fell in love again, this time around with yet another model and actress Caitlin McHugh in 2016.
