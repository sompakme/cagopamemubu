Despite being married three times, the Top Gun star has had a slew of girlfriends, and his latest one was with Russian socialite, Elsina Khayrova, but now that's as good as done.</p><p>Many believe there's another reason why Elsina Khayrova got close to Tom Cruise, and it may have to do with his $600 million net worth. We'll be taking a look at the messy events of her previous marriage and why it's seen as a red flag Cruise should've seen a mile away. Also, we'll be covering the reason behind their surprisingly quick break-up and the subtle way Elsina's ex-husband tried to warn Tom Cruise of her lavish lifestyle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-elsina-khayrova-39-s-past-makes-her-relationship-with-tom-cruise-more-bizarre>Why Elsina Khayrova's Past Makes Her Relationship With Tom Cruise More Bizarre</h2><p>It's no secret that, at 66 years old, Tom Cruise knows his way around women and is considered somewhat of a veteran in the dating world. <a href=#>Among his list of romantic partners over the years are A-listers</a> such as Mimi Rogers, Nicole Kidman, and Katie Holmes. But his most recent romance with his now ex-girlfriend Elsina Khayrova is raising eyebrows, not because of the age gap, but because of the allegations made against her about her previous marriage. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's a list of all the women Cruise has dated</a> in the past, according to US Magazine:</p><ul><li><strong>Melissa Gilbert</strong></li><li><strong>Heather Locklear</strong></li><li><strong>Rebecca De Mornay</strong></li><li><strong>Penelope Cruz</strong></li><li><strong>Nazanin Boniadi</strong></li><li><strong>Laura Prepon</strong></li><li><strong>Haylay Atwell</strong></li><li><strong>Cher</strong></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/instar53434535.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tom Cruise may have dodged a bullet with this one. RadarOnline.com reveals that, during a bitter divorce from her ex-husband, diamond trader magnate Dmitrt Tsvetkov, in 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elsina failed to disclose the entire worth of a handbag collection</a>. She tried to pull a fast one in court by stating that she only owned 20 handbags, when, in fact, there were 150, which obviously changed the worth of the items to $1 million. Her lies were looked upon unfavorably by the judge, who stated that the case was "infected by [Khayrova's] dishonesty from start to finish."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ttweb_does-tom-cruise-speak-to-his-first-wife-after-scientology-tore-their-marriage-apart-_bk_a2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Does Tom Cruise Speak To His First Wife After Scientology Tore Their Marriage Apart?">Does Tom Cruise Speak To His First Wife After Scientology Tore Their Marriage Apart?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Tom Cruise's marriage to his first wife Mimi Rogers ended under some pretty controversial circumstances.</p><p>Surely, this would put a damper on his future expectations of her if Tom Cruise was hoping for a lasting romantic connection. And, more than likely, it's partly the reason why the relationship came to an end.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-tom-cruise-meet-elsina-khayrova>How Did Tom Cruise Meet Elsina Khayrova?</h2><p>Tom Cruise and Elsina Khayrova, who is reportedly the daughter of a Putin-allied politician, Rinat Khayrova, were first spotted together in early December 2023 on the dance floor at a party in the affluent area of Mayfair in London, where they reportedly couldn't get their hands off each other. One eyewitness even said, "They were inseparable, clearly a couple." Just months before, in May, she was spotted in court with her now ex-husband over divorce disputes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/untitled-design-57.png><p>Then, in February 2024, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Cruise and Elsina Khayrova were both seen attending the five-star Raffles Hotel</a> in support of London's Air Ambulance Charity, according to Mail Online. However, they chose to arrive at the gala dinner separately and avoided taking pictures together in order to preserve the privacy of their budding relationship. Also, sources revealed that, since December, they had grown increasingly closer, and Cruise had been seen spending a considerable amount of time at her $12 million apartment in Knightsbridge, London. However, those night caps were short-lived following Cruise's announcement that their brief romance was over.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-does-elsina-khayrova-39-s-husband-think-of-her-and-tom-cruise>What Does Elsina Khayrova's Husband Think Of Her And Tom Cruise?</h2><p>After more than a decade of marriage, there's no telling how Dmitry Tsvetkov felt knowing that his newly-divorced wife was already dating a Hollywood actor as famous as Tom Cruise. But he probably isn't in too much regret after the news had surfaced that her new beginnings met an early end, shortly after <a href=#>Cruise announced that things between him and Elsina were official.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/untitled-design-43.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After dealing with a tumultuous divorce battle that cost him $188 million, he had this to say about his ex-wife's new relationship: "Irrespective of whoever she's with, Tom Cruise or anybody else, they should be aware that she likes the finer things in life and has expensive and luxurious taste. Tom should keep his eyes and wallet wide open." He then added, "I'm happy for her. I wish her all the best." If anything, this sounds like a sigh of relief that the divorce is over, and a direct warning to Cruise about what he could expect from Elsina.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ttweb_do-nicole-kidman-s-adopted-kids-refuse-to-see-her-because-of-tom-cruise-_bk_a1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Do Nicole Kidman's Adopted Kids Refuse To See Her Because Of Tom Cruise?">Do Nicole Kidman's Adopted Kids Refuse To See Her Because Of Tom Cruise?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Tom Cruise might have played a role in Nicole Kidman's reported decades-long estrangement from her adopted kids, Isabella and Connor.</p><p>It's possible that Tom Cruise caught wind of Dmitry's comments about their new romance and decided to save himself the emotional and financial strain. Mail Online revealed further details about the divorce settlement between Dmitry and Khayrova, stating that, in addition to the $1 million spent on handbags, he claimed to have spent over $12 million on clothing, which doesn't even take into account her luxury car collection and expensive jewelry. The Eyes Wide Shut actor had better keep his eyes wide open when it comes to the women he chooses to consider a relationship with, because he could be next on <a href=#>the list of high-profile celebrity divorces.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-tom-cruise-and-elsina-khayrova-break-up>Did Tom Cruise And Elsina Khayrova Break Up?</h2><p>If the revelation about her dishonesty from her previous marriage wasn't enough to scare off Tom Cruise, it's possible that something else may have convinced him to cut his losses. A recent Mail Online report stated that, just days after meeting Elsina Khayrova's children, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cruise decided to part ways from the Russian socialite.</a> In an attempt to be gracious and keep the peace, he said that he "cooled off the romance" but desired to remain friends with Elsina because they lived on the same apartment block in London.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/these-tom-cruise-movies-have-grossed-over-100-million-at-the-box-office.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tom Cruise is no stranger to relationships coming to an end, but the speed at which this one did maybe a new record for him. A source stated that, "There are no hard feelings between them and for Tom, their relationship simply ran its course."
