The writers’ contract does not outlaw the use of AI tools in the writing process, but it sets up guardrails to make sure the new technology stays in the control of workers, rather than being used by their bosses to replace them."</p><p>Although 2023's Hollywood strikes extended beyond writing, writers were the most prominent among striking creatives.</p><p>Among the agreements made to end the strike was a stipulation that AI could neither be used to write scripts, nor to edit them.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:03</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/wendy-williams-guardianship-aphasia.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Where's Wendy Williams?</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Wendy Williams' Guardianship, Purported Aphasia Diagnosis Addressed In New Documentary</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>As the Wendy Williams doc was about to air, an unnamed “team” claiming to represent her put out a shady press release about her cognitive health.</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tyler-perry-39-s-800m-studio-expansion-and-ai>Tyler Perry's $800M Studio Expansion And AI</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/tyler-perry-studio-expansion.jpg><p>As mentioned above, Tyler Perry specifically cited OpenAI's Sora video generation tool in his comments about AI and his planned studio expansion.</p><p>OpenAI's Sora itself had been a hot topic in February, often due to fears about its purported realism.</p><p>On February 22nd, Vox.com published "AI-generated video is here to awe and mislead," examining <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">strengths and weaknesses</a> with respect to the model.</p><p>Vox, like many outlets, emphasized the unsettling nature of OpenAI's Sora videos, which were released prior to the model being introduced to the public:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The artificial intelligence model is not yet open to the public, but OpenAI has released the videos, along with the prompts that generated them. This was quickly followed by headlines calling Sora 'eye-popping' and 'terrifying' and 'jaw-dropping.'</p><p>"OpenAI researchers Tim Brooks and Bill Peebles told the New York Times that they picked 'sora,' Japanese for 'sky,' to emphasize the 'idea of limitless creative potential.'</p><p>"There is another term, though, that OpenAI uses to describe Sora: a potential 'world simulator,' one that, over time, could create 'highly-capable simulators of the physical and digital world, and the objects, animals and people that live within them.'"</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:01</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stephen-kin-net-worth-2024-forbes.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Can AI Be Stephen King?

I was in the middle of, and have been planning for the last four years, about an $800 million expansion at the studio, which would’ve increased the backlot a tremendous size — we were adding 12 more soundstages.</p><p>"All of that is currently and indefinitely on hold because of Sora and what I’m seeing. I had gotten word over the last year or so that this was coming, but I had no idea until I saw recently the demonstrations of what it’s able to do. It’s shocking to me."</p><p>In the interview, Perry addressed a range of entertainment industry issues raised by AI, and expressed concerns that it would eliminate jobs.</p><p>Perry's AI opinions were not all negative, though – when asked about his experiences with AI directly, Tyler said:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I just used AI in two films that are going to be announced soon. That kept me out of makeup for hours. In post and on set, I was able to use this AI technology to avoid ever having to sit through hours of aging makeup."</p><p>According to Tyler Perry, AI video samples inspired him to put an $800 million studio expansion on hold, and in his interview, Perry said everything was "up in the air" as AI tools were adopted in Hollywood.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrbGcmr9uvMSrqbJlkZ56tMDUnaCoZZWtvaK60qKmp2c%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./here-s-how-demi-lovato-spends-her-40-million-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Heres How Demi Lovato Spends Her $40 Million Net Worth">&larr;
