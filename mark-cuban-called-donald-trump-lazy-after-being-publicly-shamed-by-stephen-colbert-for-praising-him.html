Some of Trump's memorable talk show appearances include the time <a href=#>he joked about Tiger Woods cheating</a> and when <a href=#>he talked to Jay Leno about prenups</a>. Unfortunately for Trump, people <a href=#>he has feuded with, like Russell Brand</a>, have used talk shows to call him out.</p><p>One notable example of a celebrity using a talk show to call out Trump is the time Mark Cuban called him lazy while talking to <strong><a href=#>Stephen Colbert</a></strong>. That interaction was even more interesting since Colbert called out Cuban for previously praising Trump.</p><p>This article will reveal <strong>why Mark Cuban called Donald Trump lazy</strong> during an appearance on Stephen Colbert's talk show. Then the article will look at how <strong>Cuban viciously mocked Trump</strong> earlier during the same appearance on Colbert's show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mark-cuban-called-donald-trump-lazy-after-previously-praising-him>Mark Cuban Called Donald Trump Lazy After Previously Praising Him</h2><p>On July 21st, 2016, Mark Cuban made an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Typically when Colbert has people on his show, he opens up with some friendly banter about their life and career.</p><p>When Cuban walked out on Colbert's stage to be interviewed on July 21st, 2016, the talk show host immediately confronted the Shark Tank star. <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Colbert did this by immediately calling out Cuban</a></strong> for previously <strong>stating that Donald Trump was a great thing for politics</strong>.</p><p>"I want to point something out to you, my friend. In July of 2015, you said, quote, "Trump is probably the best thing to politics in a long time. I don't care what his actual positions are."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/stephen-colbert-interviewing-mark-cuban.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If most talk show interviews began in such a confrontational way, it is easy to imagine them struggling to get guests. After all, most movie stars and musicians expect a friendly environment when they appear on a talk show to promote their latest project.</p><p>During Mark Cuban's July 21st, 2016 Stephen Colbert interview, the Shark Tank star admitted that he has thought about running for President. However, Cuban stated that he wouldn't want to put his kids through that level of scrutiny and he doesn't really like politics.</p><p>However, as Colbert quoted him, Cuban seemed perfectly happy to have his past comments brought up. Cuban seemed equally happy when Colbert pointed out his changing position on Trump. As Colbert explained to his audience, <strong>Cuban revealed that he opposed Trump</strong> the night before their interview.</p><p>"But last night on Twitter, you officially joined the never Trump club."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/melania-trump-s-shocking-reaction-to-donald-trump-s-mug-shot-says-everything-about-their-relationship-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Melania Trump's Shocking Reaction To Donald Trump's Mug Shot Says Everything About Their Relationship">Melania Trump's Shocking Reaction To Donald Trump's Mug Shot Says Everything About Their Relationship</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Melania Trump's reported reaction to Donald Trump's mug shot says a lot about what their relationship is like behind the scenes.</p><p>As Colbert stated that Cuban opposed Trump, he held up an image of a tweet the Shark Tank star posted the night before. The tweet read in part, "I have to admit I've become a #nevertrump". In response to the Shark Tank star's new position, <strong>Colbert asked Cuban to explain why his views on Trump changed</strong>.</p><p>After taking a breath for a moment, <strong>Cuban explained Trump's public statements made him realize he couldn't support him</strong>.</p><p>"At the beginning, he was a business person and I wanted to see a change from the traditional politician. But then he went and opened his mouth. You know?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/your-paragraph-text-2024-03-06t130418-314.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cuban then went on to tell Colbert that he believed that Donald Trump really could have changed how politics worked. However, <strong>Cuban stated that he believed Trump was too lazy to make politics better</strong>.</p><p>"I mean, he had a really good chance to be different and really have a chance to change things. But he doesn't do the work. He's lazy."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/759.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Melania Trump's Absence From Donald Trump's Hush Money Trial Explained By An Insider">Melania Trump's Absence From Donald Trump's Hush Money Trial Explained By An Insider</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Melania Trump has a very personal reason not to be at Donald Trump's side during his hush money trial, according to an insider.</p><p>After Cuban stated that he thought Trump was lazy, Colbert and the Shark Tank star began joking about super wealthy people. Colbert began this part of the interview by asking <strong>how billionaires he knew felt about Trump</strong>.</p><p>In response, Cuban joked around about how Trump had been kicked out of the billionaires club.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/have-mark-cuban-s-20-million-shark-tank-investments-actually-increased-his-net-worth-3.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From there, Colbert asked Cuban to opine about how rich Trump actually was at that time.

To say that <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the things that Cuban went on to say about Trump were vicious</a></strong> is an understatement.</p><p>Cuban started the segment by <strong>joking about reports about Trump's hand size and his past financial issues</strong>.</p><p>"Donald, the gloves are off. Hey, speaking of gloves, I got you a pair for your birthday. You're a child's medium, right? Donald, I've got a travel tip for you.

You're shiny, orange, and empty inside. I would say you are a traffic cone but I would swerve to avoid a traffic cone."</p><p>Cuban finished the segment by making fun of Trump's relationship with Cuban voters and how much money he really has.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqqbYrC2rsCnZJ2nnpa5pXnTq6ymqF2nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr1uv9Oep6GdnmKwsLjBnqmtZZmjwaa%2B1aKcsGc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./rhobh-s-sutton-stracke-shades-erika-jayne-s-discounted-vegas-show.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="RHOBHs Sutton Stracke Shades Erika Jayne's Discounted Vegas Show">&larr;
