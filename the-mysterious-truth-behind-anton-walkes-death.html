He had an impressive professional soccer career and was loved by fans up until his untimely passing.&nbsp;</p><p>Anton suffered injuries on January 19, 2023, in a boat mishap off the coast of Miami, where two boats collided. He was discovered unconscious afterward and rushed to the hospital, yet it wasn‚Äôt enough for him to survive.&nbsp;</p><p>Charlotte FC has announced that English defender Anton Walkes died at 25.&nbsp;</p><p>With the <a href=#>news</a> that Anton Walkes, who had recently been part of the Atlanta United team of the Major League Soccer (MLS), passed away from wounds that he acquired in a boat accident off the coast of Miami, authorities quickly launched an investigation into what caused this tragedy.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) officers, Walkes was in charge of one of the two boats involved when it went down.&nbsp;</p><p>Sadly, Walkes was declared unresponsive when they took him to provide medical attention. Subsequent resuscitation attempts were unsuccessful, and he eventually succumbed to his wounds.</p><p>Before joining MLS, Walkes also played for Tottenham in England‚Äôs top tier of soccer and Portsmouth. In memory of an amazing talent with such prominent experience in the sport, tributes started pouring in from all directions once <a href=#>news</a> about his death spread out.</p><p>It‚Äôs heartbreaking to hear that everyone in Major League Soccer is feeling such great sadness following the loss of one of their own, Tahitha Walkes.</p><p>He was beginning his second year as a defender for the Charlotte FC team and was looking forward to playing against St. Louis in their friendly match this past Saturday.&nbsp;</p><p>The league canceled that match out of respect for Walkes and all that he brought to the game and his fellow players. Walkes will always be remembered for his passion, determination, and dedication on the field. He will be sorely missed in MLS and beyond.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tributes were sent his way</h2><p>On January 19, Charlotte‚Äôs Bank of America Stadium supporters were mourning the loss of Anton Walkes, whose demise had caused much pain and sadness among those who knew him.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, they began placing flowers outside the east entrance of Charlotte FC in his memory ahead of an evening vigil to commemorate Walkes‚Äô contribution to the team and <a href=#>community</a> at large.&nbsp;</p><p>David Tepper, the club owner, noted that Walkes had been a stellar son, partner, father, and teammate, known for his enthusiasm for life that rubbed off on everyone he came across.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Tepper, Walkes embodied all that was good about Charlotte FC ‚Äì not only putting up good performances on the pitch but also serving as an example of it by positively influencing those around him.</p><p>Jaylin Lindsey, a teammate of Walkes‚Äô, lamented on <a href=#>social media</a> of a stolen chance to say goodbye to such a talented player.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The Anton Walkes news has me shook. 25 is way too young and the tragedy of such a sudden loss is way too devastating.</p><p>Again, appreciate life. Don‚Äôt ever miss out on any opportunity to be kind, to hug a loved one and to count your blessings.</p><p>Cndolences to his family and friends</p>‚Äî Nico Cantor (@Nicocantor1) <a href=#>January 19, 2023</a><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#5Forever</a> üíôüïäÔ∏è All the love to <a href=#>@AntonWalkes</a> family & the <a href=#>@CharlotteFC</a> family üíô <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/odTvfnvvDW</a></p>‚Äî Alicia Lalone (@AliciaLalone) <a href=#>January 19, 2023</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>Fly high, <a href=#>@AntonWalkes</a> üïäÔ∏èüíô <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/xTu5gAtD3d</a></p>‚Äî Brittany Alvarado (@bavacado2) <a href=#>January 19, 2023</a> <span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCtza2mp2WnlrmssdJmm56ZpJ18</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./adam-sandler-wife.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Adam Sandler Wife">&larr;
