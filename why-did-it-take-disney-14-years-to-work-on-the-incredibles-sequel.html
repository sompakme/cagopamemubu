They (Pixar) were always like, 'When you're ready.' And I finally went, 'I think I'm ready, maybe.’”</p><p>“The thing is, many sequels are cash grabs. There’s a saying in the business that I can’t stand, where they go, ‘If you don’t make another one, you’re leaving money on the table.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Leighton Meester Reveals That She Won’t Be Watching The ‘Gossip Girl’ Reboot…But Might Still Appear In It</a></span></p><p>Bird knew that The Incredibles had generated hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue for Disney, and while there was no pressure to work on a second film, he did note that while some people would have hoped for him to develop a script soon after the 2004 release of the first movie, he didn’t feel inspired enough to work on another one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It’s like, money on the table is not what makes me get up in the morning; making something that people are gonna enjoy a hundred years from now, that’s what gets me up. So if it were a cash grab, we would not have taken 14 years — it makes no financial sense to wait this long — it’s purely (that) we had a story we wanted to tell.”</p><p>The good news about such a long wait from Bird’s offering is that the process of working on The Incredibles 2 had already given him a bunch of ideas which he says he could potentially use for a third installment somewhere down the line.</p><p>While talking with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Weekly</a>, the filmmaker gushed that there was a lot of material that hadn’t been used in the sequel, including several characters that didn’t make the cut — but instead of scrapping the development of those individuals, he’s left the door open to perhaps use them for a follow-up flick.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Bridgerton’ Fans Shut Down Racist Arguments Against Inclusive Casting</a></span></p><p>“We storyboarded, and we designed characters, and they’re really good! Some of them were really funny and cool and explored certain things…” he explained.</p><p>“You know, you never say never, because there might be an opportunity to use it. Maybe the idea shows up in a different film. There was an idea I had for an animated version of&nbsp;The Spirit&nbsp;that I ended up using in&nbsp;The Iron Giant.</p><p>"You never know how these things are going to get repurposed. There were a lot of ideas that we had on this film that could be [used]… whether it’s another&nbsp;Incredibles&nbsp;film, or something else.”</p><p>The Incredibles 2 made an astounding $1.2 billion worldwide.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New Netflix Series ‘Bridgerton’ With Julie Andrews Turns Heads With New Take On Victorian London</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbalecitZK2Zm5p6pbXSp5yyZWFperqxwKuqZqyfYsSwvspmpqdlpJ2ybrXNnKmenJmXuaa%2FjKycqq2VoXw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./amir-khan-net-worth-therichest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Amir Khan Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr;
