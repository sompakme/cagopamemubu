Whether we're listening to these catchy, well-written tunes because we just went through a break-up, or we're trying to find clues about her past relationships, it's hard not to love every single song. While Taylor's fanbase might not be able to relate to dating celebrities and then writing about them when things go south, her songs are always perfectly emotional. And if they get stuck in our heads, hey, that's fine with us too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When looking back on Taylor Swift's most famous ex-boyfriends, fans are most interested in her <a href=#>past romance with Harry Styles</a>. Many people think that her song "Style" from her album 1989 is about him, thanks to the lyrics "You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye/And I got that red lip classic thing that you like/And when we go crashing down, we come back every time/'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style."</p><p><a href=#>Taylor and Harry's 2021 Grammy Awards chat</a> got fans interested in their relationship all over again. What has Harry Styles said about being in a relationship with Taylor Swift? Let's take a look.</p><h2 id=the-second-date>The Second Date</h2><p>While <a href=#>Taylor Swift and Joe Alywn's relationship</a> is definitely still going very well, it's hard not to be curious about what it was like when she dated Harry Styles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with Rolling Stone</a>, Harry Styles got very personal about his relationship with Taylor Swift.</p><p>We all remember the sweet and adorable photos of the couple walking through Central Park in 2012. Harry looked like a stylish hipster, wearing a black beanie hat, jeans, and several layers: an olive green jacket over a navy blue sweatshirt and denim shirt. Taylor looked adorable in a fashionable coat and big yellow scarf.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Billboard, Harry Styles discussed those pictures and what it was like going on that date with Taylor. He said that it was their second date and explained, "When I see photos from that day I think: Relationships are hard, at any age. And adding in that you don't really understand exactly how it works when you're 18, trying to navigate all that stuff didn't make it easier. I mean, you're a little bit awkward to begin with. You're on a date with someone you really like. It should be that simple, right? It was a learning experience for sure. But at the heart of it – I just wanted it to be a normal date."</p><p>This is really relatable to hear, as so many people feel the same way about first, second, and even third dates. It's nice to know that even a heartthrob and famous singer like Harry Styles, who many people feel must be totally cool and perfect all the time, feels that way about the dating process.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Are Taylor Swift And Miley Cyrus Actually Friends?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Harry Styles also shared that it's normal for relationships to end as not everyone is right for each other. The singer said, "Certain things don't work out. There's a lot of things that can be right, and it's still wrong. In writing songs about stuff like that, I like tipping a hat to the time together. You're celebrating the fact it was powerful and made you feel something, rather than 'this didn't work out, and that's bad.'"</p><p>Harry Styles also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">talked to Howard Stern about dating</a>. According to People, the singer explained that he likes feeling like he knows someone well because then it's easier to handle the publicity that comes with dating as a celebrity. The singer said, “It’s always kind of a balance thing, because you want to date normally but then, you also want to protect it so it can be normal. I think a big part of it is like, you want to be able to spend enough time with each other where you can get to know each other before you have to deal with the extra stuff.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is great advice for anyone, even if they're not dating a fellow famous singer.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Joe Alwyn Have The Lowest Net Worth Of All Taylor Swift's Boyfriends?</a></span></p><p>Fans love searching for clues in Taylor Swift's music and she does write songs about her past relationships. How does Harry Styles feel about that? Does it bother him or is he actually happy about it?</p><p>According to Ranker, Harry Styles sounds pretty thrilled that his famous ex-girlfriend has written some songs about their time together.</p><p>Harry said in a Google Hangout, "We write from personal experience, and I think everyone does, so it would be hypocritical of us to be like, 'Oh you can't write about us,' And she's really good, so they're good songs." He continued, "I'm really lucky in that sense."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Things Taylor Swift Has Done Since She Started Dating Joe Alwyn</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it doesn't seem likely that Taylor Swift and Harry Styles would ever get back together, fans did enjoy seeing them together for a brief period.
