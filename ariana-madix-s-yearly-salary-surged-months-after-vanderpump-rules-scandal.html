The Season ten finale of Vanderpump Rules came with a series of dramas, and the cheating scandal took center stage. This explicitly focused on <strong><a href=#>Madix, who was </a><a href=#>in a highly dramatic relationship with Sandoval</a> </strong>for nine years. The aftermath of what became known as "Scandoval" included positive and negative press, and Madix benefited from the positive aspects. This had to do with how her career and yearly earnings skyrocketed.</p><p>Following the famous Scandoval entanglement, <strong>Ariana bagged numerous brand endorsements and TV gigs</strong>, including a Lifetime movie role and a third-place win on “Dancing With the Stars, among others.” With the surge in endorsements, it was only expected that the reality star’s net worth would increase, and this article entails details of her income, career growth, and a look back at the life-changing scandal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-ariana-madix-increased-her-yearly-salary-after-scandoval>How Ariana Madix Increased Her Yearly Salary After Scandoval</h2><p><strong>Ariana Madix barely earned $10,000 when she joined "Vanderpump Rule"</strong> as a guest. In 2018, the show increased the cast’ salaries to $25,000 when Ariana became a main cast member. Depending on her episode count, Madix was earning about $600,000 per season. However, her salary increased drastically following her ex, Tom Sandoval’s cheating scandal.</p><p>On top of owning a cocktail brand and a $2.075 million shared property with Tom Sandoval, Ariana Madix's assets increased when she appeared on "Dancing With the Stars." She got third place on the show with dance partner Pasha Pashkov, and no doubt made lots of money. According to Variety, <strong>participants on DWTS earned $125,000 for the rehearsal period, and one could take home $295,000 as the show went on.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ariana-madix-4.jpg><p><a href=#>The reality TV star who made millions</a> was also cast as a police officer in “Buying Back My Daughter" in October 2023. <strong>Ariana made further success moving from Bravo to Broadway in December 2023,</strong> and she confessed it was the “biggest dream come true.” The multitalented TV personality bagged the role of Roxie Hart in Chicago from January 29 to March 24, 2024, at the Ambassador Theater in New York City. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking about her accomplishment in an interview</a> on Live with Kelly and Mark, Ariana said:</p><p>“It's just the biggest dream come true.

The star also capitalized on <a href=#>the scandal, which would later be questioned for authenticity</a> several times as a selling point. In a promotional post for Duracell on Instagram on June 9, 2023, Madix clarified that she was done with anything basic. She seemingly threw subtle shade at her ex as she noted that the battery’s 12-year life span was better than 10 years, which was how long she and Tom dated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>In a May 22, 2023, post, Ariana Madix promoted the SoFi app, which she claimed she used after she and Tom Sandoval broke up. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">She also shaded Tom through that post,</a> noting that she surrounded herself with ride-or-dies.

As per her partnership with SoFi, Madix revealed in an interview with The Times:</p><p>“I am ready to dip out, and in order to do that, I had to get my finances in order. And I partnered with SoFi in order to get that ball rolling. I really am working with that financial advisor. The post that I made was with boxes that all said ‘finances.’ There was paparazzi, like a lot of them, outside my house yesterday, even before I posted anything.
