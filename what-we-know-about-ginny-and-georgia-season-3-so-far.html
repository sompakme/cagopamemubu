It ends with <a href=#>Ginny (Antonia Gentry)</a> and <a href=#>Marcus (Felix Mallard)</a> breaking up, and <a href=#>Georgia (Brianne Howey)</a> getting arrested for another murder.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It sounds like we're getting an action-packed season 3. Here's everything we know about the show's future.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What That '70s Show Cast Thinks Of Netflix's Reboot, That '90s Show</a></span></p><h2 id=what-brianna-howey-has-said-about-ginny-amp-georgia-39-s-season-2-finale>What Brianna Howey Has Said About Ginny & Georgia's Season 2 Finale</h2><p>Speaking about her character's bitter fate in season 2, Howey said that her "heart sank," too when she saw the final episode.</p><p>"It's Ginny & Georgia; nothing's going to be wrapped up in a perfect bow, but I appreciate that because that pertains to real life and our humanity more than anything," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she told Bustle</a> of the plot twist.</p><p>"It was gut-wrenching, especially shooting it and watching Diesel [La Torraca], who plays Austin, running after the car. My heart just sank. He's such an amazing actor, but watching his sweet face and his run after his mom, I couldn't handle it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When asked what she thinks is next for her character, she answered: "What's interesting for a woman who has always thought five steps ahead and has completely orchestrated and manipulated her entire life story and identity, is this is not something Georgia saw coming."</p><p>"So, I don't entirely know. To quote Georgia, 'It's not over until it's over.' I'm sure she's starting to plant some seeds about what to do next, but this is one of the first times in Georgia's life that the rug has been pulled out from under her, and she doesn't already know what to do next."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Howey also believes that season 2 wrapped up with enough story arcs for season 3. "Story-wise we know where some potential lies, but other than that, no," she said of whether she's heard about any next season plans. "Of course, it's all surprising. Every time we go in to meet with the creator and showrunner, and we have private meetings with them to go over what to expect, it's just laughing, crying, and taking notes."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>All The Major Celebrity Cameos In Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery</a></span></p><h2 id=will-ginny-amp-georgia-have-a-season-3>Will Ginny & Georgia Have A Season 3?</h2><p>In a new interview, Ginny & Georgia creator, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sarah Lampert spoke to Deadline</a> about the show's season 2 cliffhanger, as well as whether Netflix has renewed it for season 3.</p><p>"I love surprising people, so I hope that that cliffhanger at the end of Episode 10 Season 2 was a big surprise, that's what we were going for." said the showrunner. "That being said, no, there's been no talks with Netflix about Season 3."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She added that the streaming platform is "very regimented about how they do things. So there's very much a strategy in place where I think we’ll drop it, and then we have to wait to see how it does and if we're going to see Season 3 but I certainly hope we do because it’s going to be a wild ride." Lampert then shared a few "golden" ideas for the next season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I think we've set up a lot of really great possibilities in the sense that, just playing out hypotheticals, if Georgia is being charged with this crime, we have Zion, he's Ginny's dad, we have Gill in the picture now," she explained."I think previous to this, he had no chance at custody because he was a convicted felon but who knows now, and we've got Paul, who's the stepdad. We have so many golden possibilities for storytelling based on how rich these characters are, and based on how many surprises we want to throw into Season 3 that I'm being coy about but we do have it planned out."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>These Are Wednesday's Most Important Influences, According To The Series Co-Creators</a></span></p><h2 id=what-ginny-amp-georgia-39-s-creator-has-said-about-joe-amp-georgia-39-s-future>What Ginny & Georgia's Creator Has Said About Joe & Georgia's Future</h2><p>Aside from Georgia's arrest, one of the top cliffhangers in season 2 was Joe (Raymond Ablack) confessing his feelings to the mother of two. When asked about the pair's fate, Lampert teased that viewers would just have to wait for season 3.</p><p>"Yes, she knows who he is. If you're asking if there's a romantic future for them, that would be the kind of thing you’d have to watch Season 3 to find out," she said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Howey, on the other hand, has a clearer stand on Joe's shot at being with Georgia. "Georgia's main priority is her children. She is still stuck in survivor mode," she told Bustle.</p><p>"Georgia can't even think about what she would personally want had she not lived the life and situations that she's found herself in. Right now all that matters for Georgia is maintaining security, safety, and protection for her family, and that definitely means Paul. And she is absolutely in love with him. He's so amazing with the children. It's so easy for her to fall in love with him."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a> recently reported that Ginny & Georgia has a high chance of getting a renewal after keeping its #1 spot on Netflix, days after season 2's release.
