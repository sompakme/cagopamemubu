Over the years, he has gained or lost weight to extreme levels in order to portray different characters in films like The Dark Knight, The Machinist and Vice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He did not quite go to such severe lengths with his body when he played a ruthless serial killer in Mary Harron's indie horror film American Psycho in 2000. However, he still did a lot of work to embody the character, including <a href=#>seeking inspiration from Tom Cruise</a>.</p><p>Bale's performance - which <a href=#>included some improvised elements</a> - helped to elevate the film to very impressive levels. At the box office, for instance, American Psycho managed to gross a total of $34.3 million, against a production budget of only $7 million.</p><p>Lions Gate Films were in charge of distribution of the movie. Following the success of that first film, they got fully on board and produced a follow-up, titled American Psycho 2, starring Mila Kunis and featuring William Shatner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2013, Lions Gate announced that they were partnering up with FX to create an American Psycho TV series, which would also be a sequel to the original movie. Nearly ten years later, the noise around that appears to have completely died down, leaving fans wondering whether they can still expect to eventually see the project on their screens.</p><h2 id=are-plans-for-39-american-psycho-39-the-series-still-going-on-at-fx>Are Plans For 'American Psycho', The Series Still Going On At FX?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">When Deadline first revealed</a> that there were plans being made for an American Psycho TV series for FX in 2013, they announced that it was set to be produced by Allison Shearmur (American Pie, The Hunger Games, Jason Bourne).</p><p>The writers' team was to be led by Stefan Jaworski (Those Who Kill). The premise of the series would still follow Patrick Bateman, the character played by Christian Bale in the big screen iteration.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to those early reports, 'Bateman is now in his mid-50s but still just as outrageous and lethal as ever. He takes on a protégé in a sadistic social experiment, a protégé who will eventually become his equal — the next generation American Psycho.'</p><p>In 2015, after barely any significant movement, it was reported that the project was still alive, but had no timeline for production or a release. There hasn't been any communication about any progress since, though.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Christian Bale Was Fired And The Rehired For 'American Psycho'</a></span></p><p>While this means that there is still some hope that Patrick Bateman will make his way to the small screen, the project is now in the stage often referred to in the industry as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">development hell</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=would-christian-bale-reprise-his-role-as-patrick-bateman-in-a-potential-tv-series>Would Christian Bale Reprise His Role As Patrick Bateman In A Potential TV Series?</h2><p>Christian Bale was 26 years old when American Psycho was released in cinemas around the world. He has since gone on to establish himself as one of the very biggest stars in Hollywood, winning one Academy Award and two Golden Globe Awards for his work in the films The Fighter and Vice.</p><p>With two decades gone since the cult of American Psycho, Bale is now less than two years shy of his 50th birthday. Combined with his incredible ability to transform for roles anyway, it could be argued that the next few years would be the perfect time to rope him in for an encore as a Patrick Bateman in his mid-50s.</p><p>Whether the actor would be up for the challenge is another question altogether. He had, after all been strongly advised by different people not to take the original role, insisting that it would have been career suicide.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Christian Bale, Charlize Theron And 8 Other Actors Who Are Experts At Transforming Themselves For A Role</a></span></p><p>Things did not pan out that way, however. At the same time, Bale has insisted in recent years that he is keen to slow down, and <a href=#>steer away from roles that force him to go through crazy transformations</a>.</p><h2 id=what-does-the-original-writer-of-39-american-psycho-39-think-about-plans-for-a-sequel>What Does The Original Writer Of 'American Psycho' Think About Plans For A Sequel?</h2><p>American Psycho was adopted for the big screen from the similarly-titled novel by Bret Easton Ellis of 1991. Producer Edward R. Pressman bought the rights to the book, and brought the novelist on board to write a script for a film production.</p><p>Ellis ended up deviating significantly from the book, and Pressman sought for alternative screenwriters. In the end, director Mary Harron co-wrote the screenplay alongside Guinevere Turner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following the release of American Psycho 2, Ellis voiced his displeasure, and felt that his original story was being watered down and 'franchised.'</p><p>"I've sold the rights, but I really don't know how they ended up with all of these rights," he said in a 2012 interview. "If they're not careful they could end up with something like The Pink Panther movies."</p><p>While this is not express opposition to a potential series, it does suggest that Ellis would not be amenable to seeing Patrick Bateman in a television show.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Why HBO Dropped The Series Adaptation Of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's Novel, 'Americanah'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brLXrGSapZWntqStzWanrLGTnbxuv8SqrJ6kXaiys7XErGY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./addison-rae-s-mom-sheri-easterling-speaks-out-on-marital-drama.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Addison Rae's Mom Sheri Easterling Speaks Out on Marital Drama">&larr;
