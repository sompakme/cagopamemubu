It's been almost 14 years since the last movie premiered — so do the actors still talk to each other? Keep on scrolling to find out!</p><h2 id=are-vanessa-hudgens-and-ashley-tisdale-still-friends><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Are Vanessa Hudgens And Ashley Tisdale Still Friends?</span></h2><p>Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Tisdale portrayed Gabriella Montez and Sharpay Evans in the High School Musical movies, and today the two are still close friends. They <a href=#>support each other publicly</a> but are also there for each other. Here's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what Tisdale revealed</a>:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“We actually worked together a year before in a Sears commercial, and from that day on we were super close. So people don’t really — I think some people know that, but they think it was that movie that brought us together, and it really wasn’t. She’s so awesome and one of my best friends. What I love about her is that she’s so talented, and I think what we share is that we’re really grounded people and I think that that’s important, especially with what we do, is to stay grounded."</p><p>The two ladies are currently following each other on Instagram.</p><h2 id=are-zac-efron-and-vanessa-hudgens-still-friends><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Are Zac Efron And Vanessa Hudgens Still Friends?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Who could forget that Vanessa Hudgens dated co-star Zac Efron who played Troy Bolton in the movies? The two became an item in September 2005 and fans were devastated when the couple split in February 2010. Of course, considering that they once dated it isn't surprising that the two aren't friends today. In an interview with Access Hollywood, Hudgens was asked whether she is in touch with her ex-boyfriend. "No, that's not a thing that happens. I completely lost contact with him" is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what she revealed</a>. The two are currently not following each other on Instagram.</p><h2 id=are-ashley-tisdale-and-zac-efron-still-friends><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Are Ashley Tisdale And Zac Efron Still Friends?</span></h2><p>Considering that Ashley Tisdale is still very close to Vanessa Hudgens, it certainly doesn't come as a surprise that she isn't best friends with Zac Efron.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Which 'High School Musical Star Has Landed The Most Roles Since The Franchise Ended?">Which 'High School Musical Star Has Landed The Most Roles Since The Franchise Ended?</a></span></p><p>However, Tisdale and Efron are still friendly with each other, and they often interact publicly on social media. Whether it's Efron congratulating Tisdale on getting married or Tisdale wishing Efron a happy birthday — <a href=#>the two still care about each other</a>! Tisdale and Efron are currently still following each other on Instagram.</p><h2 id=are-corbin-bleu-and-monique-coleman-still-friends><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Are Corbin Bleu And Monique Coleman Still Friends?</span></h2><p>Corbin Bleu and Monique Coleman portrayed Chad Danforth and Taylor McKessie in the popular Disney franchise. While the two haven't been spotted together often since the movies wrapped up, in 2021 fans got to see both of them star in the holiday movie A Christmas Dance Reunion. When asked, Corbin Bleu And Monique Coleman always talk nicely about each other, and they still occasionally do interviews together. The two stars are following each other on Instagram.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-ashley-tisdale-and-lucas-grabeel-still-friends><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Are Ashley Tisdale And Lucas Grabeel Still Friends?</span></h2><p>While Ashley Tisdale and Lucas Grabeel who played Ryan Evans didn't really like each other when they first met, today the two are close friends.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Fans Are Shocked By The Secret Feud On The Set Of 'High School Musical'">Fans Are Shocked By The Secret Feud On The Set Of 'High School Musical'</a></span></p><p>The two stars <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reunited in a video for Tisdale's YouTube channel</a>, and they revealed that they didn't know each other well at first. "I think we just didn't know each other and I think I was definitely a lot like Sharpay," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tisdale revealed</a>, while Grabeel added, "We just needed to live some life and go through some experiences together and learn where both of us came from, and then it happened." The two stars are still following each other on Instagram.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-zac-efron-and-corbin-bleu-still-friends><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Are Zac Efron And Corbin Bleu Still Friends?</span></h2><p>Lastly, Zac Efron and Corbin Bleu played best friends in the movies, and they are still quite close. While Efron had more success in the industry after High School Musical wrapped up, that didn't stop the two from supporting each other. Efron <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">attended Bleu's Broadway show Holiday Inn</a>, and over the years the two stars have shared photos together implying that they do still hang out. The two stars are following each other on Instagram.</p><h2 id=are-vanessa-hudgens-and-monique-coleman-still-friends><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Are Vanessa Hudgens And Monique Coleman Still Friends?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Monique Coleman And Vanessa Hudgens certainly never seemed as close as Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Tisdale, but the two ladies still remained friends. While they haven't been spotted hanging out much, they only ever have supportive and nice things to say about each other. When asked about her former castmate Vanessa Hudgens, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Coleman revealed</a> "We just actually are really close friends and I cared. You know what I mean? … I feel like so many people get into a position and then tear each other down. And it was really important for us to, like, stay very, like, tight-knit and to protect each other."

However, while Colman is following Tisdale on Instagram, it seems as if Tisdale isn't following her back.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# title="Vanessa Hudgens' Biggest Achievements Since 'High School Musical'">Vanessa Hudgens' Biggest Achievements Since 'High School Musical'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigrGWknbJur8Csq2anlmK1qrPHZqqcoJ%2BkuW651KygnJmcYsC1tculZJ%2BqmZq7pb%2BO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jake-pavelka-news-us-weekly.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jake Pavelka News - Us Weekly">&larr;
