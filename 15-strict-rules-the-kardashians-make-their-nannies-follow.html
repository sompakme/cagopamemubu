They don’t half ass their way through something, nope. If it is associated with the Kardashians, you bet it is going to be epic. From their dressing to their on-screen drama even to their relationship with one another, bare minimum is not something that sits well with them. Just think of their <a href=#>elaborate Easter party</a>. The Klan once again proved that they know how to celebrate every occasion better than the rest of us.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Kardashian-Jenner krew is also a family that is growing, with three of the Kardashian girls Kim, Khloé and Kylie all having welcomed children this year. So fast is this family growing that one has to keep an inventory just to be sure how many grandchildren Kris has.</p><p>And with children has come the need for nannies, since their busy schedules cannot allow them to be full time mums, swamped with different responsibilities including DASH boutiques, cosmetic lines and reality TV demands. They have had to enlist the help of nannies to take care of their children as they take over and run Hollywood. Well, these nannies have rules and some are just crazy. Here are 15 of them.</p><h2 id=you-just-don-t-care-for-our-kids-but-our-animals-too><strong>You Just Don’t Care For Our Kids, But Our Animals Too</strong></h2><p>When one gets hired as a nanny, it goes without saying that they have been contracted to take care of children. However, this is not necessarily the case when you are a nanny for the Kardashian and Jenner Klan. While a traditional nanny’s job is strictly kids, <a href=#>a Kardashian nanny’s</a> job description also has the inclusion of a dog, or two, or several.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When you put the combination of kids and animals, doing whatever they want at will, you realize that the experience is not as glam as you thought it would be.</p><p>It will be fun, they said. Babysitting North and Saint will be easy, they said. (Source: BabyGaga)</p><h2 id=you-don-t-wear-jewelry><strong>You Don’t Wear Jewelry</strong></h2><p>On October 3, 2016, Kim Kardashian was <a href=#>held hostage</a> in her apartment in Paris by men masquerading as policemen in her plush Paris apartment. The&nbsp;men managed to get away with 8 million pounds worth of jewelry.</p><p><strong>After that incident, the entire family was badly shaken and decided to be a bit more cautious because it was a sign that people knew just how rich they really are.</strong></p><p>One of the precautions that Kim has taken, apart from storing jewelry away from home, is that <a href=#>no one - including nannies- wears jewelry</a>. This is to make sure that robbers don’t find their way back to her house. (Source: TheSun, TheTalko)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=be-on-call-no-matter-the-time><strong>Be On Call…No Matter The Time</strong></h2><p>As we have mentioned before, the Kardashians have a very busy lifestyle. This means that they are always on the go and have a lot going on in their lives. Therefore, they are in need of their nannies at all times. The nannies have to be on call and ready to go when called upon, irrespective of what hour of day or night it is.</p><p>The nannies are also expected to travel with the children to whichever part of the world the&nbsp;girls&nbsp;are expected to be - whether it is a <a href=#>Ski trip to Colorado</a> or to Greece while shooting their TV series Keeping Up with The Kardashians. (Source: Vogue)</p><h2 id=be-ready-to-be-micromanaged><strong>Be Ready To Be Micromanaged</strong></h2><p>It is no secret that the Kardashians and the Jenners love control…a lot of control for that matter. They want to be at the helm and keep an eye on everything and pay close attention to every detail, especially when it comes to their children.</p><p><strong>One former staff member, speaking about <a href=#>Kourtney Kardashian</a>, said that the mother of three would want to control everything to the point of being a neat freak.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She said that Kourtney was always checking in on the nanny, asking them what they were up to and micromanaging everything, making it hard for them to do their jobs. (Source: BuzzingPlanet)</p><h2 id=no-photos-of-the-children><strong>No Photos Of The Children</strong></h2><p>One of the requirements of having the celebrity status that the Kardashians do is not to be camera shy, to be proficient and ready to give a good shot to paparazzi and tabloid reporters who follow them wherever they go.</p><p><strong>We are also living in a time where everybody wants to capture and preserve memories of their days, especially if their days are surrounded by the Kardashian-Jenner sisters. However, as a nanny, this is <a href=#>strictly forbidden</a>.</strong></p><p>The Kardashians are very protective of their children and their children’s image and taking a photo of their kids, no matter how precious the moment is, could earn you a spot on the unemployment line. (Source: BuzzingPlanet)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=everything-is-done-the-kardashian-way><strong>Everything Is Done The Kardashian Way</strong></h2><p>Everybody has a unique way in which they like to do things, and the Kardashians are no different. However, when it comes to this bunch, it becomes more than just a preference, but a requirement, especially when it involves their most prized possessions, their kids.</p><p>A <a href=#>nanny does not just show up with her own style of doing things</a> and think that she can impose this on Kim. One former nanny once stated that Kim is so specific with how things are done that she blew her top one day when she found sweaters were not folded to perfection and had to be done again. Sheesh! (Source: TheRichest)</p><h2 id=you-must-dress-for-the-cameras><strong>You Must Dress For The Cameras</strong></h2><p>Often, the staff will be caught on camera with one or several of the Kardashians. This is more so the case for the nannies when the gang decides to go for an event as a family or even if it’s just strutting about town. Being next to such high profile celebrities means that you are bound to appear next to them in some of the snaps taken.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For this reason, the nannies are required to be at their <a href=#>very best fashion-wise</a>. Wardrobe malfunctions, color clashing and bad fashion choices are a definite no-no if you desire to keep working for the Kardashian Klan.</p><h2 id=you-will-be-told-where-to-stand><strong>You Will Be Told Where To Stand</strong></h2><p>If you are the kind of person who likes to meander along the sidewalk, sauntering at your own pace with RayBans on while sipping a mocha? Well then, a Kardashian nanny job is definitely not for you.</p><p><strong>Apparently, it is alleged that Kim and Kanye coordinate where everyone in their entourage will walk when they are out and about.</strong></p><p>Mrs. West likes it when everyone in her entourage spreads out behind her in a <a href=#>‘V’</a> formation like when geese fly south for the winter.</p><p>Now imagine juggling between watching Saint West and at the same time struggling to make sure you don’t mess up your position on the entourage.

It may not directly be your fault, but you will have to take the heat for it. (Source: BabyGaga)</p><h2 id=the-kardashians-come-first><strong>The Kardashians Come First</strong></h2><p>Working for the Kardashians—or any celebrity, for that matter—is not easy. You are made to work unconventionally long hours with little to no breaks in between and are on call <a href=#>whenever you are needed</a>. It’s definitely a full-time job. Sometimes, emergencies involving family and sickness can occur and we assume that in such instances, the nanny can be excused to attend to it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This makes many of the nannies not to have much when it comes to their personal lives, as the Kardashians-and their needs-always come first. This means no dating or even hanging out with friends. They are forced to put everything else on hold and focus solely on working for the Klan. (Source: TheTalko)</p><h2 id=you-have-to-be-calm-even-in-the-midst-of-crises><strong>You Have To Be Calm Even In The Midst Of Crises</strong></h2><p>The life of a celebrity is only glam to those of us outside looking in. All we see is the high-end parties, red carpet glitz and all the faithful followers that tail them wherever they go.</p><p><strong>What we may be quick to overlook, however, is the stress, pressure, and madness that comes with being an A-list celebrity like Kylie Jenner and Khloé Kardashian.</strong></p><p>A celebrity’s worst nightmare can sometimes come in the form of paparazzi, who are sometimes willing to go to any length and risk anything just so they can catch that precious shot that will be worth something for tabloids and glossy magazines.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During this commotion, the nanny is <a href=#>expected to be calm</a> and to focus, making sure that the kids are okay. (Source: BabyGaga)</p><h2 id=kids-must-wear-certain-outfits><strong>Kids Must Wear Certain Outfits</strong></h2><p>The Kardashian children are the unpaid brand ambassadors for their International fashion lines K-Dash, ShoeDazzle and the Kris Jenner Kollection. Every article of clothing that they put on can either build or put a major dent in the brand that the Kardashians are trying to build.</p><p>Because of this, the mums are very specific about what their kids put on, where and for how long. Photos are also taken of the kids all the time and this makes them even more careful about what their children wear.</p><p>There was an uproar on Instagram when North West was <a href=#>pictured</a> wearing a dress that looked like a corset and Kim had to defend her decision, saying that it was decoration and not a corset.</p><p>What if it was the nanny that put that dress on North? (Source: DailyMail)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=no-questions-asked><strong>No Questions Asked</strong></h2><p>It does not matter whether you are liberal or conservative. When it comes to the way the Kardashian/Jenner clan live their lives and raise their children, your <a href=#>opinion does not count in any way.</a></p><p>Whether you are against the manner of discipline or lack thereof when it comes to North and Saint West, or are slightly beguiled when Penelope and Mason decide to sleep with their mum on her bed, as a nanny you need to learn to keep such reservations to yourself and not question the mother or her manner of raising her children.</p><p>Your job is to take care of the children and you should stick to that. You ain’t no Dr. Phil. (Source: BabyGaga)</p><h2 id=you-won-t-be-on-the-show><strong>You Won’t Be On The Show</strong></h2><p>If you have taken note, throughout the seasons of Keeping Up With The Kardashians - 14 so far – the <a href=#>nannies never get face time</a>. In fact, if one was to purely rely on the show for information, you would get the impression that the Kardashian kids are raised solely by the parents without the help of nannies. Sometimes, the kids do not appear on the show at all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>There may be a good reason why the nannies are never shown or it could be the nannies themselves who requested to be left out of the show.</strong></p><p>However, they still get a fair amount of time in the limelight whenever they are out with the Kardashians, with several photographs showing them caring for the stars’ children. (Source: NYMag)</p><h2 id=the-pay-may-be-low><strong>The Pay May Be Low</strong></h2><p>The Kardashians are loaded, everybody knows this. Each of the sisters has a lucrative chunk which substantially contributes to the Kardashian Empire. This would make anyone who has thoughts of working for them a tad giddy at the prospect of the good pay and fat Christmas bonus.</p><p><strong>However, this has never been confirmed nor denied, with former employees and nannies never speaking up concerning just how well, or poorly, the Kardashians remunerate.</strong></p><p>This too, in light of the <a href=#>allegations</a> that came to light concerning one of the companies for one of their clothing lines was paying workers less than ten cents per garment.
