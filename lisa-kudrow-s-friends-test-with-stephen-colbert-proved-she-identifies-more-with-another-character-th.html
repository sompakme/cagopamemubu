While talking with Stephen Colbert, host of The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, Kudrow revealed she had taken a quiz to see which character from her hit show, Friends, she most identified with.</p><p>Many fans are familiar with online quizzes, asking those taking them a series of questions to determine which character they might identify with the most from their favorite show, based on the answers they give.</p><p>Lisa Kudrow took a Buzzfeed quiz for the iconic sitcom Friends. She was surprised when the answer popped up, especially after she revealed the types of answers she'd entered, attempting to get a Phoebe result from the quiz.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/5.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Lisa Kudrow's Character Guide: Ranking The Best Roles The 'Friends' Star Has Taken On</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Lisa Kudrow's talent, versatility, and dedication to her craft have solidified her as a beloved and influential figure in Hollywood.</span><p>During their interview, when Colbert asked the star, "Have you ever taken one of those Buzzfeed's (quizzes) - which Friends (character) are you?" Kudrow admitted she had, "I did, I did, I did take one."</p><p>The host then asked The Comeback actor about the results of the quiz, wondering if Kudrow had gotten the character she herself made famous: Phoebe Buffay. "What Friend are you?" Colbert asked, "Rachel," Kudrow responded, causing things to take a surprising turn as the two burst into laughter.</p><h2 id=lisa-kudrow-told-stephen-colbert-the-surprising-results-of-the-39-friends-39-test>Lisa Kudrow Told Stephen Colbert The Surprising Results Of The 'Friends' Test</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/steven-colbert-show.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many fans of the show might wonder if any of the actors truly identified with their characters. Some might know that <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston and her character Rachel Green surprisingly had something in common</a>. <a href=#>Courteney Cox nearly lost her gig on Friends when she turned down Rachel</a>, because she better identified with Monica Geller.</p><p>During an interview on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, host Stephen Colbert asked Lisa Kudrow if she'd taken a test to see which character from Friends she identified with the most. Kudrow made Phoebe Buffay an iconic character on the hit show, and attempted to answer the quiz questions the way Phoebe herself would answer them. However, she was taken aback when she got the results: Rachel Green.</p><p>After telling the host the answer was "Rachel," he grinned broadly and tried to hold back more laughter. Colbert then asked, "Did you- Because that seems like the fix is in, did you take it again? To say like, there's got to be another 'friend' (character)."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kudrow replied she'd only taken it once, answering each question as Phoebe herself. "No, I was exhausted by taking it the first time. And also, I thought I was answering questions like, that would bring me to Phoebe, you know? Like, favorite color? Yellow! Who would you want to go on a date with? SpongeBob!" (SpongeBob SquarePants is a fictional cartoon character)</p><p>"And it just said Rachel," She added. Colbert wondered if he might have missed something from the show when she mentioned a date with SpongeBob. "Is that a Phoebe thing? Did I miss something in the Phoebe Canon that she had the hots for SpongeBob?"</p><p>Laughing, Kudrow explained, "Well, there were like, real people in the mix too, so I don't know why..." she began chuckling again, then explained, "It's 'so Rachel' to choose an animated character to go on a date with. I didn't understand their criteria."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lisa-kudrow-initially-identified-with-rachel-green-39-s-character>Lisa Kudrow Initially Identified With Rachel Green's Character</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lisa-Kudrow-Friends.jpg><p>During her interview with Stephen Colbert, Lisa Kudrow revealed she initially identified with Rachel Green's character. "It's funny because when I first read the script, and I was going to be auditioning for Phoebe, I saw Rachel, and I just went, Oh! That's like a Long Island JAP (Jewish-American Princess) that could be hilarious. I could identify with that more."</p><p>However, the showrunners disagreed, and felt Kudrow was better cast as Phoebe, "But they said, 'No, no. Phoebe.'" In order to secure the role of Phoebe Buffay, Lisa Kudrow had to go through an extra audition none of the other main cast members needed to go through, and didn't find out until years later she'd been the only one who did.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/your-paragraph-text-2023-11-01t130653-418.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Lisa Kudrow Was Forced To Dish Out Over $1.6 Million After Losing A Case Involving Her Residuals From Friends</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Lisa Kudrow was on the wrong end of a lawsuit launched by her former manager pertaining to her time on Friends.</span><p>It's interesting that Kudrow initially identified with Rachel Green's character, and the Buzzfeed quiz the Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion actor took also gave her the same results, despite Kudrow answering questions the way she felt Phoebe would have answered.</p><p>Some quizzes might reveal the actors from Friends identify more as different characters than the ones they actually played.
