Their sensitive and honest conversations led to an engagement and saying yes at the altar on the incredibly popular <a href=#><strong>Netflix</strong></a> reality series. Unlike some other couples who have majorly struggled on the show, Nick and Danielle didn't seem to have any big hurdles to get over. But by the summer of 2022, their relationship was finished and they were beginning the process of thinking about the next stage of their lives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In May 2023, Danielle shared that she and Nick were spending time together on her Instagram Stories, which made fans wonder if there was any chance that they would get back together. Has Danielle Ruhl moved on after divorcing Nick Thompson and has she been in another relationship?</p><h2 id=is-danielle-ruhl-dating-anyone-after-breaking-up-with-nick-thompson>Is Danielle Ruhl Dating Anyone After Breaking Up With Nick Thompson?</h2><p><a href=#>Danielle and Nick's lives after divorce</a> must be tough since they seemed to really hope that their marriage would last.</p><p>Based on interviews and her social media presence, Danielle doesn't seem to have connected with anyone the way that she did with Nick. She hasn't posted about dating anyone and she doesn't share about going on casual dates, either.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/love-is-blind-danielle-ruhl.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Going through a break-up or divorce is of course never going to be easy. And it's going to be even worse when both partners are famous, especially because they met on a reality series like Love Is Blind that gets so much attention. It's possible that Danielle hasn't met anyone that she cares about.</p><p>It's also possible that she hasn't been going on dates consistently. According to E! News, Danielle said in September 2022, "I don't think I'll be ready to date anytime soon. It takes me a long time to get over people. We're still going through the divorce process. Dating is not in my near-term feature right now."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Love Is Blind Contestants Were Allegedly Treated Poorly On Set, But Did Anyone Have A Good Time Filming The Hit Netflix Series?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When watching Danielle Ruhl in season 2 of Love Is Blind, it was clear that she wanted fans to get to know her as a person. It's definitely fair to say that she is one of the most open cast members who has ever appeared on Love Is Blind. She discussed having anxiety and being nervous about sharing more with Nick Thompson.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/danielle-ruhl-nick-thompson-love-is-blind.jpg><p>While of course no Love Is Blind fan wanted Danielle to suffer while filming the reality series, it was good that she talked about what she was dealing with.

She said, "There's no real closure... Just getting divorced publicly without being able to talk to him, I didn't act the best."</p><p>When asked if they could ever date again, Danielle said "I'm going to be incredibly transparent about how immature I acted." She said "it's one of my biggest regrets." She also noted that if they did date in the future, she would hope that the people in his life would be okay with that because of how she acted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Cole Barnett From Love Is Blind Revealed His DMs Exploded With Proposals Following His Time On The Reality Show</a></span></p><p>Both Danielle and Nick have given interviews about how bad filming Love Is Blind was in terms of not having food, water, and mental health resources. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Danielle said that she went to therapy for eight hours at a time when Love Is Blind was over.</p><p>Danielle said of her relationship with Nick, "It impacted both of us, and he did his best. It takes a lot of patience from both sides.

And this is why fans find their divorce so upsetting to hear about.</p><p>In an interview with the podcast Love In Reality, Danielle shared that she felt bonded to Nick in the pods. She said "You could feel the energy on the other side. It was funny, we would say that we would know that it was going to be the other person... I just would have this feeling."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/love-is-blind-danielle-nick-1.jpg><p>On the same podcast, Danielle explained that when the season 2 Love Is Blind cast were in Mexico, Nick knew that she was feeling anxious and made sure that she was okay.</p><p>Danielle also said of her divorce, "It wasn't just something that happened overnight." She said that they wondered "is this more of an emotional connection?" and "I think we came to the conclusion that we just were not compatible." She mentioned that when thinking about purchasing a home and starting a family, they could tell that things wouldn't work in the long term.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Danielle opens up a lot on her Instagram account and fans likely feel that they are following a friend and not a reality star who feels like they are living a very different life than them. Whether she finds love or she and Nick do get back together, it's very likely that Danielle Ruhl will share all about it on her social media and fans will be the first to know.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmqaZmrmtsYyrrKGkXZmutbXNoGSapqmku6Z5wJ%2Brnqpdo7akt4ytn6iloKi8r3nDoq2oqpOaeq271Z5koqtdl7mqusNmqp6Zo6S7bn6MnJisrF8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-hotel-gyms-are-very-much-like-landing-pages.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Hotel Gyms are Very Much Like Landing Pages">&larr;
