Although people have practically seen her blossom from girlhood to adulthood in the songwriter's seven years in the music industry, she still seems to find ways to surprise fans by revealing personal things about her life. However, in recent years, she has kept one thing about her very much a secret: her tattoos.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What about Billie's tattoos that she likes to hide fans about? Did she regret doing any of her tattoos? That's why she's keeping it hidden from the people? How many tattoos does she have as of July 2022? Keep reading to find out...</p><h2 id=how-many-tattoos-does-billie-eilish-have>How Many Tattoos Does Billie Eilish Have?</h2><p><a href=#>Billie Eilish has had her fair share of several outfit scandals</a> as she discovers her style outside what adults dictate her to wear. However, if there's one aspect of her life that she doesn't let people tell her what to do, it's getting tattoos.</p><p>In 2021, Billie Eilish only had two tattoos: the black dragon tattoo on her leg and a fairy tattoo on her left hand. But in 2022, she revealed that she added another to the collection as she got an 'Eilish' tattoo near her sternum.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Billie Eilish Told David Letterman "They Laugh" At Her Touretteâ€™s Syndrome</a></span></p><p>Her tattoos seemed to confuse fans as they had previously photographed her with other small tattoos on her neck. Although Billie didn't address the confusion, fans assumed that those were only temporary tattoos that disappeared after some time.</p><h2 id=what-does-billie-eilish-39-s-tattoo-mean>What Does Billie Eilish's Tattoo Mean?</h2><p>The enormous tattoo Billie Eilish has is her black dragon tattoo on her open leg, moving up to her hip. The 21-year-old has not revealed the personal meaning behind this tattoo, but as the dragon has different implications for everyone, fans generally think her tattoo somehow correlated to strength and protection.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The second tattoo Billie got is her fairy tattoo on her hand, which she had done in 2021. IN an Instagram story where she answers fans' questions, she says that her current favorite tattoo is the fairy one. In her interview with Vanity Fair, she says that her hand tattoo is her "sweet little guardian angel fairies," which she got inspiration from one of her favorite books, Fairyopolis, written by Cicely Mary Barker.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Not Everyone Is Thrilled About Billie Eilish Commenting On The Heard-Depp Trial In Her New Song</a></span></p><p>The latest edition of her collection is her 'Eilish' tattoo. She says, "I [Billie Eilish] love myself," explaining why she had her surname tattooed near her sternum.</p><h2 id=billie-eilish-39-s-39-secret-39-tattoo>Billie Eilish's 'Secret' Tattoo</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In 2021, Billie Eilish only revealed two out of three tattoos</a> to the public through her yearly interview with Vanity Fair. As she was re-watching her video from last year, the pop singer<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> surprisingly changed her mind about keeping her tattoos a secret</a> and pointed out the placement of all her tattoos.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She even admitted that she lied in the previous year when she said, "I [Billie Eilish] did get a tattoo, but you'll never see it." Billie's fans found it funny that she threw her old self under the bust by admitting her bluff, but it's one of the reasons why her annual interview with Vanity Fair became a must-watch.</p><h2 id=why-did-billie-eilish-lie-about-her-tattoos>Why Did Billie Eilish Lie About Her Tattoos?</h2><p><a href=#>Billie's journey to body positivity</a> has gone through ups and downs, and one of its effects on her is her struggle to open up about herself to the public openly. Although Billie hasn't directly admitted that she hid her tattoos for some time because of what negative comments could come from it, fans believe it had a relatively significant impact on her decision.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As Billie also opened up more in her yearly interview with Vanity Fair, the younger version of Billie Eilish cared more about what people could think negatively of her. But compare that to who she is now, she cares more about her happiness than others' judgment.</p><h2 id=does-billie-eilish-regret-any-of-her-tattoos>Does Billie Eilish Regret Any Of Her Tattoos?</h2><p>Despite many fans questioning Billie on her tattoo placements, especially on 'big boy,' her enormous leg tattoo, it seems that the 21-year-old is still in tattoo euphoria, and it is unlikely that she regrets any of it so far.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billie Eilish being a tattoo lover</a>, her mother, Maggie Baird, has opposing feelings about it. Billie even tells Vanity Fair, "My mom hates tattoos," when asked what her family feels about it. However, despite her mother's aversion, Billie is eyeing another tattoo shortly after finishing up her next tattoo design.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Billie Eilish's Sweet Revenge To Ex-Boyfriend Brandon Adams Got Her A Grammy Award</a></span></p><p>Answering the question if she plans on getting another tattoo soon, she says, "I [Billie Eilish] have some more ideas. Right now, I feel pretty satisfied. I feel like in a good zone with them [current tattoos]. Give me a little more time, and I'll get another one [tattoo]." With how Billie has matured and learned to care less about what others think, it seems unlikely that she will stop getting tattoos just because a few people don't like them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9doq6vxYytmK2sn6TAbrDOnqpmmpmhuaqxjJ6gpaGjnXqprdWeZJqmlGKxqrCMrJ%2BeZaKatLOx02aYp7Ff</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-much-are-tlc-s-darcey-and-stacey-silva-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Much Are TLC's Darcey And Stacey Silva Worth?">&larr;
