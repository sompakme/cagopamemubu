Some believe he is the next Mr. Beast. Others compare him to a modern Nathan For You.</p><p>However, Forbes discovered that his journey as a creator is eerily similar to Elon Musk’s journey as an entrepreneur.</p><p>He is a YouTuber known for his comedic vlogging and his “couch series” collaboration with Logan Paul. His interaction with Paul on the other hand has a different story.</p><p>Airrack flew to Miami in January 2020 where Paul was present for his brother Jake’s boxing match against AnEsonGiband. He pretended to be a reporter in order to convince Logan to work with him.</p><p>He spent thousands of dollars to fly to Miami and book a hotel room, with no guarantee of meeting Logan.</p><p>He was then known for making expensive vlogs and challenge videos in the style of MrBeast, but with different video ideas and on a smaller scale.</p><p>Airrack’s videographer and editor from North Carolina is believed to be responsible for much of the channel’s success in 2020. He’s responsible for the iconic Airrack graphics and fast-paced storytelling.</p><p>Airrack learned to optimize his approach to meeting and collaborating with other creators as their channel grew.</p><p>Prior to YouTube, Airrack ran a successful wedding videography business, which provided him with the necessary experience and funds to launch his channel.</p><p>Eric has recently launched a pizza sauce called “Pizzafy,” launched a merch line, and hosted a YouTuber ping-pong tournament.</p><p>He is next co-founding Creator Now with his managers Zack Honarvar and Kate Ward. There, they are assisting in the development of the next generation of creators.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-airrack-from></span>Where Is Airrack From?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Airrack is a comedian Youtuber originally from Georgia.</p><p>He aspired to be a full-fledged YouTuber, and he simply decided that 2020 would be the year. He achieved his goal of 1 million subscribers by 2021.</p><p>He has nearly 10 million subscribers in just two years of time. Eric stated that his initial goal was to reach 20 million subscribers in five years, but after this year’s success, he believes he can do better.</p><p>His new mission is to “become one of the biggest YouTubers on the planet.” Furthermore, he intends to focus on other platforms in order to build his brand and eventually break into the top 20 YouTube creators in the world.</p><p>Eric will continue to release as much groundbreaking content as possible in the coming years, which he believes is part of the key to his success.</p><p>Airrack has decided to throw his subscribers, the world’s largest pizza party at the end of 2022 if he reaches 10 million subscribers.</p><p>Airrack has decided to speak with a Pizza Hut employee about throwing the world’s largest pizza party.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=some-faqs></span>Some FAQs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-airrack-girlfriend></span>Who is Airrack girlfriend?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Airrack is in a loving relationship with Hope Lavine.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-hope-lavine></span>Who is Hope Lavine?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Hope works as a bridal fashion stylist.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-airrack-from-2></span>Where is Airrack from?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Airrack is oroginally from Georgia but now resides in LA, California.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-youtuber-airrack></span>How old is Youtuber Airrack?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>He is 25 years old, as of 2022.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-airrack></span>Who is Airrack?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Airrack is a comedian vlogger and Youtuber who has 9,93 million of subscribers on his channel.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJmZp7%2Bir8pmnqKqnJu%2FqrHNnWSiq12dsm61zWaYZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGLEqsDHZp%2BoqJViuaLCyKecaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./david-akers-net-worth-therichest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="David Akers Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr;
