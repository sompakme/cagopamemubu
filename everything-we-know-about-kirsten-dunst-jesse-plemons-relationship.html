They broke up in 2016, and most people felt surprised. Two months after their split, Dunst and Plemons were spotted kissing, and people started to speculate if it was something serious. It didn't take long until the press and fans had their answer.</p><p>After the photos were published, the couple didn't try to hide their relationship.

Since they became a couple, they provide little information about their relationship, but it is obvious how they admire each other as professionals and human beings. Last year, Plemons said that he was nervous about meeting Dunst because she was <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of his favorite actresses</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I looked into her eyes and saw the beautiful, sweet, unguarded, welcoming, human being that she is.

The actress said that she likes to keep things private, but shared some details about their relationship.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Demi Lovato And Max Ehrich & 9 More Celeb Couples Who Got Engaged Quickly</a></span></p><p>The actress said they became really good friends firsts, and it was something that paved the way for their romance. Dunst said he proposed when she was sick, and she saw it as a good sign.

"It's a priority, but you know how life is. You've got other little things. So it has to be a good time when we can all have fun," <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dunst told US Weekly</a>.</p><p>The actress said that the coupe was planning an intimate wedding, with few friends and family.

Of course, everyone was curious and wanted to know if they tied the knot in a secret ceremony.</p><p>It is something that would make sense since they are both discrete when it comes to their relationship. Kirsten Dunst explained in an interview that they were not married. "Fiancé, we're not married yet," <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she said</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-are-spending-time-in-new-zealand><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>They Are Spending Time In New Zealand</span></h2><p>In 2020, the couple decided to rent a home near Auckland in New Zealand. They had to spend time there due to Dunst's latest film, The Power of the Dog, but they are having the best time there. Kirsten Dunst and Jesse Plemons wanted to give their son the chance to live near nature and "have some grass to run around on," <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she said</a>.</p><p>"There are horses around here. And we have two old cats living with us, one of whom, Sid, brings us a mouse every night. ... Yesterday, we let [Ennis] be naked all day, and he'd pee outside in the grass.
