This can <a href=#>push people to extremes</a>, and it can make things <a href=#>difficult on set for the other performers</a>. Some actors <a href=#>are completely against it</a>, but others will embrace it, often times turning in award-winning performances.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For Man on the Moon, <strong><a href=#>Jim Carrey</a></strong> opted to go method, and this did help him turn in an amazing performance that proved he could do a bit of everything on screen. However, the experience wasn't pleasant for the rest of the people on set, and Carrey has drawn criticism for his behavior.</p><p>Let's take a look back at the movie, and how Jim Carrey too things too far.</p><h2 id=jim-carrey-was-fantastic-in-man-on-the-moon>Jim Carrey Was Fantastic In Man On The Moon</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar29747315.jpg><p>In the galaxy of cinematic history, certain stars shine brighter than the rest, emitting a unique luminosity that captivates audiences for generations. Among these celestial entities, Man on the Moon holds a special place, a radiant masterpiece that orbits the realm of reality and imagination.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In terms of commercial success, the film encountered its own gravitational pull. Earning approximately $47 million worldwide against a budget of around $52 million, the film hovered precariously around the break-even point. The masses, it seemed, were divided on boarding this cinematic spacecraft, unsure whether they were signing up for a comedic voyage or an existential odyssey.</p><p>Central to this celestial odyssey was Jim Carrey's performance, a tour de force that showcased the extent of his virtuosity. Transforming into the eccentric comedian Kaufman, Carrey was nothing short of mesmerizing. His embodiment of Kaufman was so seamless, it was as if the man himself had been resurrected and was performing his own posthumous encore.</p><p>Carrey's dedication to the role bordered on the divine. Not only did he mimic Kaufman's mannerisms and vocal quirks with surgical precision, but he also delved deep into Kaufman's psyche, capturing the essence of his perplexing blend of comedy and absurdity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To pull off this performance, Carrey opted for the method route, a decision that aided his performance, and took things too far when the cameras weren't rolling.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jim Carrey Revealed His Religious Beliefs During An Emotional Speech To A Room Of Inmates</a></span></p><h2 id=jim-carrey-39-s-method-acting-took-things-too-far>Jim Carrey's Method Acting Took Things Too Far</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar29746172.jpg><p>Paul Giamatti, who co-starred in the film, opened up about his experience with Carrey, painting a less-than-stellar picture of the way <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">things unfolded on set</a>.</p><p>"It was a very strange experience. It was one of the weirdest experiences I've had making a movie, to be honest with you. It was just wacky. Jim was wacky during it. He did this whole thing where he was Andy Kaufman all the time when he was on set and when he was in the costume, and was Tony Clifton all the time when he was Tony Clifton," said the actor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Giamatti also gave insight on Carrey's time playing Kaufman's alter ego, which saw him do some disgusting stuff on set.</p><p>"When he was Tony Clifton, he had cheese — Limburger cheese — in his pockets so he smelled horrible," Giamatti explained. "And he'd constantly be hugging people, and he had it all over his hands and stuff. It was disgusting. He was touching people and making them shake his hands all the time. He smelled horrible. Like, really bad. It was just weird. And that's the least of it," Giamatti continued.</p><p>It's also been rumored that Carrey lost himself in the role, and that he even had an incident with WWE legend, Jerry Lawler, managing to get on Lawler's bad side.</p><p>For Carrey, however, the method route earned him rave reviews, and marked just another time that he was willing to go above and beyond for a role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The True Reason Why Jim Carrey Nearly Went To Court Over His Late Ex-Girlfriend, Cathriona White</a></span></p><h2 id=carrey-has-gone-to-extremes-for-other-roles>Carrey Has Gone To Extremes For Other Roles</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar29732558.jpg><p>For his time playing the Grinch, Carrey underwent <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">training with the CIA</a>.</p><p>To get into character each day, Carrey underwent 8 hours of make-up, something that was difficult for the actor.</p><p>"The first day was eight-and-a-half hours and I went back to my trailer and put my leg through the wall," he said.</p><p>Brian Grazer, an Oscar-winning producer, got Carrey some help, specifically, learning how to stray distracted.</p><p>"If you’re freaking out and spiraling downward, turn the television on, change a pattern, or have someone you know come up and smack you in the head, punch yourself in the leg, or smoke - smoke as much as you possibly," Carrey revealed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Carrey has described what it was like wearing the iconic costume, and it sounds miserable.</p><p>"I couldn’t see. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t scratch myself. The physical restraints were unbelievable. It was just like having a refrigerator strapped to your back," he said.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jim Carrey Saw A Salary Increase 20 Times Larger Of The Initial Offer For Dumb And Dumber, But Jeff Daniels Wasn't As Lucky</a></span></p><p>Jim Carrey absolutely took things too far as Andy Kaufman, but given his experience on that set, no one can question the man's commitment to a role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdn7auecKaqaudqah6rrHToaadZZGYwaq6xmaaq6ejqHq1tMRmo6KmlWK2r3nMmqVmp55iwamxjKamqKZf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kelly-oubre-jr-wife-who-is-kelly-oubre-jr-s-fianc%C3%A9e-shylynnitaa.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kelly Oubre Jr. Wife: Who Is Kelly Oubre Jr.s Fiance Shylynnitaa?">&larr;
