Celebrities are rich, famous and popular. Some of them have thousands of screaming and adoring fans that will break down in tears at the slightest sight of them. Celebrities can have anyone they want and everyone wants to be their friend. However, there is a dark side to being a celebrity. There is a constant pressure from the people around them to remain skinny, beautiful, muscular, smart and likable. They’re under the harsh and constant media spotlight. TMZ and other tabloid journalists track celebrities like hunters hunting their&nbsp;prey. There is also the intense and crushing pressure that celebs put on themselves. Sometimes they crack under all the pressure and can turn to drugs and alcohol or their behavior can become destructive. It’s hard for any celebrity to deal with the lifestyle and it can sometimes lead to rehab.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Young celebrities might actually feel even more pressure to remain attractive and perfect.
