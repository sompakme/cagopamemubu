In less than a week, over 80 lives were lost, properties burned down, and thousands of people were evacuated. Amid the evacuees—and, fans can guess, the property losses—were notable celebrities who own homes on Hawaii's various islands.</p><p>High-profile celebrities like <strong><a href=#>Owen Wilson</a></strong>, <a href=#><strong>Jim Carrey</strong></a>, Steven Tyler, Willie Nelson, <a href=#><strong>Oprah</strong></a>, Jeff Bezos, and more own properties on Maui, and some have already lost their mansions. Amid those losses, Mick Fleetwood's famed restaurant was burned to the ground, causing not just a loss of property and income to him and his cofounder, but impacting the community, too.</p><h2 id=who-owns-fleetwoods-on-maui>Who Owns Fleetwoods On Maui?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mick-fleetwood.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anyone who has visited Fleetwood's on Front St. on Maui already knows that it's owned by Mick Fleetwood; the large sign outside the restaurant and bar declares it proudly. Over the years, Fleetwood's has welcomed countless guests, and since the restaurant opened in 2012, Mick is often spotted there, too.</p><p>Commenters on social media often shared stories, on either Mick's posts or those of the restaurant, to say how great the ambiance was and thank Mick for his hospitality. The restaurant was well-known for its delicious dishes, as well as being something of a hotspot in Lahaina.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Which Fleetwood Mac Song Made The Band The Most Money? The Truth About Their Best Singles</a></span></p><p>The location on Front St. offered live entertainment (including various events that were planned throughout August), handcrafted cocktails (starting at $14 per glass), and boasted a cozy atmosphere; the restaurant's tagline on its "Visit" page read "We believe in ohana."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sadly, all of that came to an end for Mick when his restaurant was lost during the Maui fires.</p><h2 id=mick-fleetwood-39-s-restaurant-burned-to-the-ground>Mick Fleetwood's Restaurant Burned To The Ground</h2><p>Along with much of the surrounding area on Maui, Mick Fleetwood's Fleetwood's on Front St. reportedly burned to the ground around August 10th, 2023. That day, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mick posted on his official Instagram account</a> that "Fleetwoods on front Street has been lost and while we are heartbroken our main priority is the safety of our dear staff and team members."</p><p>Giving "heartfelt thoughts and prayers for the people of MAUI," Mick noted that the "devastating" moment was impacting people all over the island, calling other losses "unimaginable."</p><p>Commenters flocked to Mick's post to talk about their fond memories at the restaurant and give prayers to the people of Maui.</p><p>For Mick, the loss was particularly personal, as he has lived in Maui for a long time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-did-mick-fleetwood-move-to-hawaii>When Did Mick Fleetwood Move To Hawaii?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mick-fleetwood-on-the-red-carpet.jpg><p>As Mick wrote in his Instagram post noting the loss of his restaurant, "MAUI and The Lahaina community have been my home for several decades." In one interview in which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he spoke about his restaurant and coffee businesses</a>, Mick chatted about his roots in Hawaii.</p><p>His close friend, who helped launch a coffee blend with Mick later, moved to Maui in 1991. When Mick began frequenting the island (and taking his famed photographs), he met Gerard Marti, who owned a gallery.</p><p>Gerard 'inspired' Mick to showcase his work, which led to his photography being shown not just in Maui, but in other places, too. The two later collaborated on Mick's coffee line, years after they had already become "dear friends."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Lindsey Buckingham Use A Fleetwood Mac Song To Get Back At Stevie Nicks After Their Break Up?</a></span></p><p>At the time of the interview, Mick explained that he lived in Hawaii but had, of course, toured around the world with his band. That exposure to different places in the world helped inspire his coffee line; Mick spent time in Ghana and Kenya to choose his coffee beans and blends.</p><p>Mick also hinted that he owned more than one restaurant in Hawaii, although Fleetwood's on Front St. was obviously the most well-known. In 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mick gave an interview where he talked about plans to open a gallery and retail spot</a> called Mick's House of Fleetwood in Paia.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">House of Fleetwood in Lahaina</a> apparently opened in 2014, and its address is in Lahaina, whereas the 2021-discussed store would be at the "entrance to Paia." As of the Maui fires, there was no official listing for the Paia location, though it did have a Yelp listing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Employees at Mick's House of Fleetwood in Lahaina confirmed via Instagram that the retail building was entirely lost.</p><h3 id=does-mick-fleetwood-still-live-in-hawaii>Does Mick Fleetwood Still Live In Hawaii?</h3><p>By all accounts, Mick Fleetwood still lives in Hawaii; most of his recent Instagram posts are snapshots from the island, some of them in his restaurant. Mick often stopped by the restaurant to chat with guests and even perform <a href=#><strong>music</strong></a> for them.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Are In Agreement That Fleetwood Mac Has A Worst Song Despite Their Legacy</a></span></p><p>In the interview about House of Fleetwood, Mick talked about how he would have more time to spend on the island since <a href=#>Fleetwood Mac was no longer touring</a> for years at a time.</p><p>It's not entirely clear where Mick lives, or how close his home was to the restaurant or his retail locations, but some sources hint that his home is "near Napili Bay," which is in Lahaina.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=did-mick-fleetwood-39-s-house-burn-down>Did Mick Fleetwood's House Burn Down?</h3><p>As of August 12th, 2023, Mick Fleetwood has not revealed whether his home was affected by the fires on Maui. It's unclear whether he owns homes in other places.</p><p>Amid his bankruptcy filing (though many believe the <a href=#>band could have been worth billions</a>) years ago, it was revealed that Mick had bought a "luxury rental property" in Hawaii for $400,000. Per Celebrity Net Worth, the property is rented for $1,400 per night.</p><p>He was said to still own the Hawaii property at the site's last update, and <a href=#>his net worth has recovered since the bankruptcy filing</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mick also owned properties in Australia and Malibu</a>, and he once owned a Victorian country house in the '70s; Mick reportedly left Benifold in 1974 to move to California.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdorakt4yfo56dpKy8sLDSZqmeq6SWwrOtza1km62io3qwuoymmK6hXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-sally-field-really-had-to-say-about-playing-the-amazing-spider-man-s-aunt-may.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Sally Field Really Had To Say About Playing The Amazing Spider-Man's Aunt May">&larr;
