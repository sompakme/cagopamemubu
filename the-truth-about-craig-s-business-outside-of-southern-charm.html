For example, actors only worried about which role they would get next, athletes only cared about performing in competition, and musicians focused on performing and recording great songs. These days, however, it seems like almost every star spends their days and nights planning how they will branch out.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>8 Pairs Of Celebrities Who Teamed Up To Start A Business Or Charity Together</a></span>One of the most common ways that stars seem to be branching out these days is <a href=#>by launching businesses</a>. For example, almost everyone seems to know that <a href=#>Ryan Reynolds has become the face of aviation gin</a> largely since he has an ownership stake in the company. Thankfully for them, there are many examples of <a href=#>stars running extremely successful businesses</a> but the truth of the matter is that some celebrities have owned companies that went bankrupt. With that in mind, many Southern Charm fans want to know how Craig Conover’s business is performing today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-bravo-rsquo-s-southern-charm-about>What Is Bravo’s Southern Charm About?</h2><p>Unfortunately, there are a lot of people in the world that are unfairly stereotyped. For example, for some reason, there is a long history of some folks looking down on and judging people from the south. With that in mind, Bravo has been airing the show Southern Charm since 2014.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Southern Charm: 10 Pics Of The Cast Comparing Season 1 To Now</a></span></p><p>From the moment that Southern Charm debuted, viewers have gotten the chance to see that people from the south are just like everyone else. After all, Southern Charm focuses on a group of rich and famous socialites and even though they may speak with a southern accent, they get in the same kinds of drama that other “reality” stars do.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Southern Charm features a fairly large ensemble cast, it is pretty clear that Craig Conover has always been at the center of the show. For that reason, a lot of the show’s fans are most interested when he is on their screen. For example, fans want to know about Conover’s personal life and his career as a business owner.</p><h2 id=how-is-craig-conover-from-southern-charm-rsquo-s-business-performing>How Is Craig Conover From Southern Charm’s Business Performing?</h2><p>For most people, the idea of becoming a “reality” star would be daunting enough. After all, spending every day knowing that your personal life is going to be under a magnifying glass would inspire a lot of people to curl up in a ball. On top of that, “reality” stars always need to make sure they are doing something interesting when the cameras are around since nobody would watch a show about people doing boring things.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Reality TV Stars Who Got Themselves Fired</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amazingly enough, even though Craig Conover has starred in the “reality” show Southern Charm since 2014, he has also found the time to be a business owner and operator as well. As the co-owner and face of the company Sewing Down South, Conover makes a living as the head of a company that manufactures and sells goods like pillows, face masks, and baseball hats.</p><p>Unfortunately for Craig Conover and other business owners like him, the last few years have been very difficult. After all, during the pandemic, a lot of people turned to the ease of ordering things off Amazon since most brick-and-mortar stores were closed and shipping costs from smaller businesses were too high. With that in mind, it would have made sense if Craig Conover’s business Sewing Down South went belly up during the pandemic since that is the fate that far too many small companies suffered.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fortunately for Craig Conover, there is absolutely no doubt that Sewing Down South hasn’t gone bankrupt. In fact, there are several pieces of information about Conover’s business that seemingly indicate that the business is likely to be doing better as of this writing than at any time in the past.</p><p>Since Sewing Down South is privately owned, the company doesn’t have to reveal anything about its sales figures or business prospects to the world. As a result, there is no way for anyone other than Conover and a handful of people in his life to know exactly how well Sewing Down South is performing as a business. That said, from the outside looking in, it certainly seems like things are going great for Sewing Down South.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the last several months, Craig Conover has been very busy creating loads of new opportunities for his business. For example, Conover has been willing to put in the time to expand his business by setting up booths at industry events. For everyday customers who want to see Sewing Down South’s products in person, they can visit <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the company’s recently opened store</a> in Charleston, South Carolina. On top of all that, Conover and his business partner invested the time and money to create <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a modern and easy-to-navigate website</a> where fans can see Sewing Down South’s new poolside collection. Even though Conover and his partner could be expanding their business even though it is failing, it seems much more likely they are making all these moves to keep their company ascending.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Everything We Know About The ‘Southern Charm’ And ‘Summer House’ Mashup Series</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecKrmKKfXZu%2FsLmMrKaurJiav695wqGYq6VdmbyqusZmpaivXZfCtLXNnqqsZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./15-things-the-kardashians-don-t-want-you-to-know-about-their-childhood.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Things The Kardashians Don't Want You To Know About Their Childhood">&larr;
