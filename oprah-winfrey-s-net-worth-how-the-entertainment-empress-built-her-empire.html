Club succeeded, transforming unknown authors into bestsellers solely through her life-changing endorsements.</p><p>When Oprah chose a book for her club, a book sales frenzy ensued, which publishers

percent after Oprah recommended it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a savvy
