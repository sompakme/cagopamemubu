Oprah made much more money by maintaining ownership holdings rather than receiving a salary in full.</p><p>Thanks to the show, she had an unmatched platform to market her book club, magazines, and other sponsorship deals.</p><p>The Oprah Winfrey Show had a huge cultural impact, assisting Oprah with building a loyal following of millions of people and establishing her as a household name.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=harpo-productions>Harpo Productions</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/smithsonian-channel-tm-and-oprah-winfrey-s-harpo-productions-the-color-of-care-_-official-trailer-0-21-screenshot.jpg><p>Oprah's ownership stake in Harpo Productions, the company she founded, was also instrumental in generating significant wealth.</p><p>Through Harpo, Oprah was able to produce her talk show and other media projects, allowing her to maintain creative control and benefit financially.</p><p>Successful films, like the critically acclaimed Beloved in 1998, brought substantial profits directly to Harpo — and Oprah as CEO.</p><p>Oprah's shrewd business acumen allowed her to secure ownership stakes in multiple co-production ventures. She was able to amass a significant amount of wealth, which far exceeded what can be achieved through earning regular wages.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong>

appeal and financial success.</p><p>With editions spanning the globe, the monthly publication consistently generated substantial subscription and advertising revenues year after year.</p><p>Using her brand and wide-reaching influence, the magazine served as an additional source of income and fortified Oprah's thriving business empire.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top

Club succeeded, transforming unknown authors into bestsellers solely through her life-changing endorsements.</p><p>When Oprah chose a book for her club, a book sales frenzy ensued, which publishers eagerly sought.</p><p>In 2011, ratings agency Nielsen published <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">case studies about Winfrey's influence</a> on book sales, with sales one title jumping nearly 900 percent after Oprah recommended it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a savvy businesswoman, Oprah arranged partnerships that gave her a portion of the profits from the book sales her picks generated.</p><p>Throughout the book club's 25-year tenure, Oprah earned millions of dollars in royalties.</p><p>Furthermore, the book club strengthened her position as a taste maker, allowing her to promote books that reflected her principles while also enhancing her brand's cultural
