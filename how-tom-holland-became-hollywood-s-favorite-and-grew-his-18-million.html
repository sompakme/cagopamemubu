Since then, he has been collaborating with Marvel playing Spiderman in various movie installments. After starring in his standalone movie <a href=#>Spider-Man: Homecoming</a>, Holland skyrocketed to fame. Besides the MCU, he has starred in various movies such as The Devil All The Time, Onward, Cherry, Chaos Walking, and so on. With thousands of fan pages and long lines at Comic-Con, his charming, down-to-earth personality and his diligent choices of movie roles have contributed to many fans and an increase in his star value. After achieving the status of an A-List actor, thanks to his Spider-Man role, his net worth has shot up considerably. Here's how Tom Holland has amassed his considerable wealth since his foray into Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-theatre-kid-turned-hollywood-star>A Theatre Kid Turned Hollywood Star</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Failure Before Success</a>, Holland's interest in theater was a natural sequence, taking into account the dance classes he took at Nifty Feet, a UK-based dance studio. Before he graced the big screen and became Spider-Man, Tom Holland was well on his way to becoming a young star. He grew up in an artistic family, with his dad being a comedian and author and his mom a photographer. He took dancing lessons and attended the BRIT School for Performing Arts and Technology. At a young age, he starred in a production of Billy Elliot The Musical. Holland also learned gymnastics during his time in the musical.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Real-Life Thor Story: Here's How Chris Hemsworth Grew His Million-Dollar Fortune</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Billy Elliott, he starred in the movie The Impossible in 2012, his first onscreen role, acting alongside <a href=#>Ewan McGregor</a> and Naomi Watts. The film earned $180.3 million worldwide while attaining critical and commercial success, and Holland won several accolades for his performance. The following year, he played the role of Isaac in How I Live Now and reprised his character in Billy Elliot the Musical Live. Holland has been vocal about being a big fan of Spider-Man long before being cast as the web-slinger, claiming to own Spider-Man bedsheets and going to fancy dress parties in Spider-Man clothes.</p><p>He acted in several other films from 2013 to 2015 before joining MCU.</p><h2 id=superhero-earnings-as-spider-man>Superhero Earnings As Spider-Man</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 25-year old's stardom was brought on by Marvel’s Captain America: Civil War in 2016, where he first took on the cape of the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider</a>&nbsp;reports, he later tweeted that his life was flipped upside down after he signed a six-picture <a href=#>contract with Marvel Studios</a>. Captain America was a huge critical and commercial success, grossing over $1.1 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film in 2016. He was reportedly paid his first big paycheck of $250,000 for the supporting role he played. He later scored other movies such as Edge of Winter, The Lost City of Z, and others, raking in even more money for him.</p><p>The following year Holland reprised his role as Spider-Man in Spider-Man: Homecoming. The film opened to positive reviews, and Holland earned considerable praise for portraying the character despite being so young. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seventeen</a>, homecoming grossed $800 million globally and brought him a Guinness Book of World Records tag as the youngest actor to play a titular role in MCU. This role was a breakthrough for him as it skyrocketed his career and set him up for future success. Despite making a big splash, he only earned a base salary of $500,000 for the first movie in the Spider-man series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Homecoming, Holland’s salary soared, and he earned a respectable $3 million for his appearance in Avengers: Infinity War. The British actor now has a fixed base salary of $4 million to $5 million per film appearance. While Holland’s yields from the Spider-Man movies were not officially disclosed to the public, the first film swept more than $880 million at the box office. The movie’s humongous success would have most likely granted the actor a substantial remuneration. The second movie in the franchise, Spider-Man: Far From Home, grossed $1 billion at the box office, becoming the highest-earning Spider-Man film yet, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">First Post</a>.</p><h2 id=upcoming-no-way-home-and-contract-renewal>Upcoming No Way Home and Contract Renewal</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Holland’s next film as the teenage superhero Spider-Man: No Way Home graces the theaters this December. According to the latest reports, Holland has asked for four times the amount for his comeback to the <a href=#>Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> than his previous remuneration for the last few flicks.</p><p>Having become the youngest charming actor on the roster since his introduction to Marvel Universe, the company made him stay for five flicks in total, three of which were standalone movies. He earned big as the solo flicks brought him $5 million each. Following his pay hike to re-enter the Marvel Cinematic Universe, his income from the movie is $20 Million. It isn’t clear if the amount is for each film he does or an all-over deal. But in both cases, this is a sizeable pay hike for an actor of his age and experience.</p><p>The third installment is expected to be worldwide after Holland’s greatly lauded performance in the previous movies. He will star alongside Benedict Cumberbatch’s Doctor Strange and Zendaya’s Mary Jane in the upcoming film. It will also bring back past Spider-Man movie villains such as Dr. Octavius, Green Goblin, and Electro.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=roles-outside-of-mcu>Roles Outside of MCU</h2><p><a href=#>After his success in Marvel</a>, Holland was cast in several movie roles, making him one of the most popular Hollywood actors. It looked as though every big movie coming out had him in it, including The Devil All The Time, Cherry, DoLittle, Chaos Walking, and Onward. Chaos Walking earned $21.9 million, and Onward made $141.1 million in the box office while DoLittle made a whopping $251.4 million, and the rest of the films premiered on streaming services. The British actor earned quite a fortune for himself playing some critically acclaimed and popular roles through such means.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tom Holland is reported to collect $4 to $5 million base pay for each movie, and he is worth around $15 million to $18 million. With a full-blown successful career, Holland is set to amass greater net worth in the years to come.
