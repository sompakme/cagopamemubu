People have become famous for many reasons; creators like Good Mythical Morning are known for being a daily entertainment show. Other creators like Pewdiepie are loved for their reactions while playing video games. Then, there are those who are perhaps best known for causing drama.</p><p>Anyone who knows anything about YouTube has likely heard these names before: Logan and Jake Paul, Shane Dawson, and Jeffree Star. These are just a few of the creators who have reached headlines this year, and here is the drama that surrounds them</p><h2 id=logan-paul-called-out-his-own-brother><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Logan Paul Called Out His Own Brother</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/screen_shot_2018_01_02_at_6-28-02_pm-0.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Logan and Jake Paul are names that are pretty much household to those who know anything about social media influencers or YouTubers. The brothers are constantly making headlines, and often for all the wrong reasons.</p><p>Both boys, however, <a href=#>have put in the time and effort build a career in boxing</a>. One of the big drama points the Paul brothers have faced this year involves some sparring. Logan publicly called out Jake Paul after a boxing fight, stating that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jake gets beat up by his sparring partners</a>. Needless to say, Jake was not happy about this proclamation.</p><h2 id=logan-paul-also-made-insensitive-comments-towards-zayn-malik><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Logan Paul Also Made Insensitive Comments Towards Zayn Malik</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To add to the ever-growing <a href=#>list of Logan Paul's controversies</a>, earlier this year he targeted ex One Direction member Zayn Malik. Malik has been pretty good about staying out of the headlines, except for rumors surrounding his relationship with Gigi Hadid.</p><p>While on an episode of Andrew Schulzâ€™s Flagrant Podcast in June of this year, Logan made some insensitive remarks regarding Malik's race and background. After talking about where Zayn may be from due to his "ethnic look," he joked with Andrew about how he probably hit Yolanda Hadid "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">because of his culture.</a>"</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Obscene And Awesome Ways Logan Paul Spends His Huge Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=jeffree-star-addressed-rumors-of-dating-kanye-west><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jeffree Star Addressed Rumors Of Dating Kanye West</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jeffree Star is another YouTuber who is used to <a href=#>having their name constantly in the tabloids</a>. Star has gone through dramas involving other YouTubers and influencers, as well as pop culture celebrities, perhaps the most famous being <strong><a href=#>Kanye West</a></strong>.</p><p>A couple of years ago, a rumor was started that Jeffree Star and Kanye West were having an affair. Likely because of the proximity in which they lived, but otherwise there wasn't much to base this idea off of. Jeffree went onto the Impaulsive podcast to address these accusations and shared the truth: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">there was no truth to these rumors</a>, and they were made by a bored TikToker who wanted attention.</p><h2 id=addison-rae-39-s-parents-are-bringing-crazy-drama-into-the-family><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Addison Rae's Parents Are Bringing Crazy Drama Into The Family</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/addison-rae-parents-2-03abc9cab78f44d78f8c0ab999706466.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Addison Rae is an Influencer that grew on YouTube before joining TikTok. She went on to star in a <a href=#><strong>Netflix</strong></a> original movie, He's All That. Though Addison herself is pretty good about staying out of the headlines, <a href=#>her parents have been bringing in nonstop drama this year</a>.</p><p>Just in 2022, Rae's mother, Sheri, showed up to the MTV Video Music Awards hand-in-hand with rapper Yung Gravy. The two were later spotted sharing a kiss. Addison's father, Monty, was caught in an affair with a 25-year-old model around the same time Sheri and Gravy went out together. Needless to say, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rae is mortified by the drama surrounding her parents</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Was Addison Rae Before TikTok?</a></span></p><h2 id=shane-dawson-came-back----next-to-jeffree-star><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Shane Dawson Came Back -- Next To Jeffree Star</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/jeffree_star_dawson-0.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Among the many feuds between YouTubers over the years, two that have had the most beef are makeup artist <a href=#>Jeffree Star and long-time content creator Shane Dawson</a>. Whether their drama comes from a place of sincerity or as a ploy to gain more views, these two continued to have it out on the platform.</p><p>Earlier this year, Shane Dawson came back to YouTube after several months off, returning with an apology video. Although the intention was likely to set things right with his subscribers, it had the opposite affect, <a href=#>as many called these feelings fake</a>. Nevertheless, Dawson has teamed up with Star, and the two are in multiple videos together on Shane's channel.</p><h2 id=the-try-guys-affair-scandal><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>The Try Guys Affair Scandal</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perhaps the biggest scandal to come from YouTube this year is <a href=#>the drama surrounding The Try Guys</a>. This group of four friends have been doing videos together for years, starting on BuzzFeed before branching off and forming their own company. They have gone on tour together, released a co-authored book, and done incredible things.</p><p>In the fall, it came out through a fan sighting that <a href=#>Ned Fulmer of the Try Guys was caught cheating</a>. Not only was he having an affair after being married for many years, but it was with a subordinate from his company, who was also engaged to someone else at the time.</p><h2 id=hank-green-vs-keith-from-try-guys><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Hank Green Vs. Keith From Try Guys</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To end on somewhat of a lighter note, the most recent YouTuber drama comes from Hank Green and another member of The Try Guys, Keith Habersberger. Hank, <a href=#>a longtime YouTuber who is still making content</a>, is a vlogger, science enthusiast, entrepreneur, and author. He and his brother, John, are well-known among the online world.</p><p>Well, just in the last month, he called out Keith in a TikTok video for using the "millenial pause" when making an announcement, meaning he waited a moment before speaking in his video. In return, Keith retorted in a (faux) rage-filled video that was then stitched several times over by Hank. While the two are actually good friends, it is perhaps one of the more entertaining dramas surrounding YouTubers this year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dl7aos8Ssq2axn6rBtq7EZpurmZ2WwG67xWZpaWpiZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./these-lucky-brand-wedge-booties-can-make-any-outfit-breathtaking.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="These Lucky Brand Wedge Booties Can Make Any Outfit Breathtaking">&larr;
