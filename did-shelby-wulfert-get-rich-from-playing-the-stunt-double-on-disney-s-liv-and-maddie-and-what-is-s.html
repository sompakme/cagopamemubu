It's true that <a href=#>Disney had a 65 episode rule</a> and many shows ended around that time. Still, it was a shame to say goodbye to the sweet show about twins who couldn't be more different from each other. Liv Rooney was an outgoing actress and Maddie Rooney cared more about athletics than anything else. The characters got up to many silly adventures. And, of course, they often pretended to be each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dove Cameron played both main roles. But since she doesn't have a twin sister, two stunt doubles were used. Shelby Wulfert was the stunt double for Maddie and Emily Buckner was the stunt double for Liv. Was this lucrative for Shelby Wulfert? And what has she been doing in the years since Liv And Maddie went off the air?</p><h2 id=what-was-shelby-wulfert-paid-to-be-liv-and-maddie-39-s-stunt-double>What Was Shelby Wulfert Paid To Be Liv And Maddie's Stunt Double?</h2><p>The <a href=#>Liv And Maddie cast stayed close</a>. It definitely seems like starring in the Disney show was a great time for everyone. And in the years since, fans have kept up with the actors. It seems likely that the Liv And Maddie cast was paid well. But what about the stunt double Shelby Wulfert?</p><p>Shelby Wulfert's Liv And Maddie salary is unknown. And her net worth doesn't appear to be available, either. However, it's possible to guess what she could have been paid based on figures available for stunt doubles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/shelby-wulfert-dress.jpg><p>If a "stunt performer" or "stunt person" is part of the Screen Actors Guild, then the union dictates their daily rate. A <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stunt double can be paid</a> $1,005 per day, according to a Chron article from 2020. The website also noted that if someone did a really dangerous stunt, like driving a fast and chaotic car, they could be paid $5,000 more.</p><p>Since Wulfert wasn't doing any tricky or wild stunts as Maddie's double, she must have been paid the SAG union rate. And since Liv And Maddie was on the air for four seasons, she must have done pretty well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to J-14, when viewers thought that they were looking at both Liv and Maddie, it was really Dove Cameron and Shelby Wulfert. The publication reported that the series also relied on special effects. The camera would also be used in a certain way to make it look like Cameron was playing twins.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything The Cast Of 'Liv And Maddie' Has Been Up To Since The Show Ended</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shelby Wulfert talked about Liv And Maddie</a> in an interview with Nicolefong.com and shared that she wore a wig to film her scenes. She also shared that she enjoyed being on set because she was curious about what everyone's jobs were. She mentioned learning a lot from Kevin Sullivan, Liv And Maddie's associate director.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/shelby-wulfert-pink-dress.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wulfert also talked about how thrilling it was when she was hired. She said, "At the callback I had a chemistry read with Dove to see how alike we looked. Casting told us to stand nose to nose and toes to toes, which is slightly awkward when youâ€™re meeting someone for the first time! I just kept making silly faces to try to lighten the mood."</p><p>Wulfert continued to Nicolefong.com, "After that I actually had to do a basketball assessment, which was the most terrifying part! I practiced for hours the day before. And then a few days later they called to say I had booked it, which felt amazing!"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Happened Between Thomas Doherty And Dove Cameron?</a></span></p><p>It seems like Shelby Wulfert had a great time on Liv And Maddie. And the cast still seems to be in touch. Just Jared Jr. reported in 2017 that when the other stunt double, Emily Buckner, got engaged to Max Chucker, Buckner asked Wulfert to be a bridesmaid.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-do-shelby-wulfert-39-s-career-and-life-look-like-today>What Do Shelby Wulfert's Career And Life Look Like Today?</h2><p>Although Shelby Wulfert was a stunt double on Liv And Maddie, she is also an actress. She continued to act a little bit after the series was canceled. However, none of her credits are as memorable as Liv And Maddie.</p><p>Wulfert played Hannah in Swiped, a 2018 movie about a college student who builds a dating app. After that, she appeared in a few episodes of the sketch show Betches. In 2019, the actress starred in two movies, Playing With Fire and Blue Call.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/shelby-wulfert-smiling.jpg><p>Wulfert also played Joanna in one episode of All American, which aired in 2022. This was just a one-off role, however.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Dove Cameron's Singing Career 'Comeback' Mean She'll Stop Acting For Good?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although she may not have a lot of film and TV credits to her name, Wulfert seems to keep busy. In September 2019, she shared on Instagram that she had starred in a musical called Ranked at the UC Davis Ground and Field Theater Festival. She posts a lot about her love for her family and friends, which is sweet to see.</p><p>Shelby Wulfert not only worked on Liv And Maddie for four years. She also met her husband there. Lucas Adams played Liv's love interest Josh Willcox. And in July 2021, Wulfert and Adams got engaged. In October 2022, the two got married. Wulfert shared many wedding photos on her Instagram account. Adams is also known for starring on Days Of Our Lives.</p><p>In an interview with People about her wedding, Wulfert said that they are thinking about starting a family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/shelby-wulfert-1.jpg><p>She said, "This marks the beginning of starting to really build our family together and what that means for us. We want to have kids in a couple of years so starting to prepare for that next chapter of being parents and the next chapter of the rest of our lives."</p><p>Wulfert also told People that she and Adams liked each other for a while before they started dating. She said, "We were friends first. And then after a while, Lucas was so sweet. He was like, 'I have to tell you that I have a crush on you.' And then after that I was like, 'Oh, thank goodness. I do too!' "</p><p>Based on her comments, it seems like perhaps Shelby Wulfert will continue to act if she finds projects that she wants to be part of. But it definitely sounds like becoming a parent is what she wants most now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brjIr5xmmZ6Zeq6tw52gnmWjqcKvwIydpq6anJp6tLTEpZmyZaequaex0a1krJmclr%2B6ec2eq7Cnoqm1cA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jamie-lynn-spears-is-blessed-to-have-mom-lynne-amid-britney-claims.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jamie Lynn Spears Is 'Blessed' to Have Mom Lynne Amid Britney Claims">&larr;
