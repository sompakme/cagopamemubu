Tragically, Rivera passed away after accidentally drowning this past summer, and Morris has expressed her condolences along with the rest of the cast. It was an especially terrible loss for her as their characters celebrated their wedding day in the sixth season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Some Glee actors love each other</a> and others have had some bad blood over the years. Heather Morris has always seemed like a friendly face and a relatable actress, and she's also got a lot of money in the bank. How did Heather Morris amass her $4 million net worth? Let's take a look.</p><h2 id=4-million-net-worth>$4 Million Net Worth</h2><p>Lea Michele&nbsp;has a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$12 million net worth</a>, which makes sense as she played the main character, Rachel Berry, on&nbsp;Glee. While Morris's character wasn't given quite as much screentime, she did play an important part in the series. And Morris might not have quite as much as $12 million in the bank, but she still has $4 million which is a ton of money.</p><p>It seems fair to say that Heather Morris made a lot of her money portraying Brittany on&nbsp;Glee, as she appeared in 96 episodes over six seasons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Morris has a few other acting credits to her name that would have contributed to her net worth. In 2017, she starred as Jenna in the TV movie&nbsp;<i>Psycho Wedding Crasher&nbsp;</i>and played the main role again in the 2018 TV movie&nbsp;Pretty Little Stalker. She also has a handful of film roles, such as Lily in the 2011 movie&nbsp;Post&nbsp;and Bess in 2013's&nbsp;Spring Breakers.</p><p>Most recently, Morris played Emily in a 2019 movie called&nbsp;Santa Fake&nbsp;and appeared in nine episodes of a TV series called&nbsp;I.R.L.&nbsp;which aired in 2018.</p><p>Before getting into acting, Morris was a backup dancer on&nbsp;The Beyoncé Experience world tour back in 2007, which is amazing to hear about.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Attack Glee’s Heather Morris for Defending Deceased Co-Star Mark Salling</a></span></p><h2 id=time-on-dancing-with-the-stars>Time On 'Dancing With The Stars'</h2><p>Heather Morris also competed in season 24 of the popular reality series&nbsp;Dancing With The Stars. It does pay to be on&nbsp;DWTS&nbsp;so this would have contributed to her net worth as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">contestants were still on the show in the third week</a>, they could get paid "extra money per episode on a sliding scale," according to&nbsp;Cosmopolitan. The publication noted that according to&nbsp;Variety, people could make up to $295,000.</p><p>Morris competed with her partner,&nbsp;Maksim Chmerkovskiy, and they came in 8th place.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Cosmopolitan, all contestants get paid $125,000 for rehearsing and weeks one and two. That means that Morris definitely got some money for her time on this competition series.</p><p>When Morris and&nbsp;Chmerkovskiy were eliminated from the show in the spring of 2017, they sounded pretty sad to be off the series. Morris told&nbsp;Entertainment Tonight,&nbsp;"I feel like, [as] with any show that you watch on TV, it's like, you don't really know what's coming next. I was kinda preparing for anything that could happen or could come my way. So it was like, 'OK, if this is going to happen, let's just be positive and go out the right way.&nbsp;Everybody is so fantastic here and just so welcoming, [so] it was like,nice to [know] that I'm going to say goodbye, but I'm also going to see these people again."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jane Lynch Got This One Role Because Of Her Height</a></span></p><h2 id=life-on-glee>Life On 'Glee'</h2><p>In June 2020,&nbsp;people said that Lea Michele had been rude on the set of&nbsp;Glee, and Heather Morris shared her take on the matter. According to&nbsp;Us Weekly, she said,&nbsp;“Let me be very clear, hate is a disease in America that we are trying to cure, so I would never wish for hate to be spread on anyone else. With that said, was she unpleasant to work with? Very much so; for Lea to treat others with the disrespect that she did for as long as she did, I believe she SHOULD be called out."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lea Michele Isn’t The Only Mean Girl: These Celebs Have Been Slammed For Their Diva Behaviour</a></span></p><h2 id=life-today>Life Today</h2><p>According to Cheat Sheet, Heather Morris has a podcast, The Dance Room, that talks about TV shows that focus on dance, from Dancing With The Stars to Dance Moms. It's cool that she has found a place for her passion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Morris is married to Tayler Hubbell and the couple has two children. Morris once said that having a family was what really mattered to her: she said,&nbsp;"I want to marry him so bad. That's what I really care about. I want to marry Taylor and have kids with him. I love acting, but if it affects my relationship, then I won't continue doing it," according to&nbsp;Bustle.com.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s Why Jane Lynch’s ‘Glee’ Role Was Close To Her Heart</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dnLmmsYysq5qqXZ2yosDHnqlmpZ%2Bnv6q%2FjJqkmqujmrFutMSrZG1lnZ65rbXOp2SnnaRixLC%2B06Fm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-james-cameron-became-a-hollywood-legend.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How James Cameron Became A Hollywood Legend">&larr;
