It became an everyday staple for kids who want to watch funny and entertaining cartoons for 22 minutes. However, when Disney announced its surprising end, fans wondered why it ended so suddenly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Did the Phineas and Ferb show's lack of viewership cause its cancellation? Was the show forced to shut down? Will there be an upcoming Phineas and Ferb version 2.0? Keep reading to find out the details...</p><h2 id=why-did-phineas-and-ferb-get-canceled>Why Did Phineas And Ferb Get Canceled?</h2><p>After Disney officially announced that Phineas and Ferb would air its last ever episode on June 12, 2015, many theories surfaced about why they suddenly wanted the show to end.</p><p>Some fans speculate that it might be because Phineas and Ferb have raised a red flag to the Disney management about some inappropriate scenes they've included in the show. As there have already been many instances where <a href=#>Disney cartoons were low-key inappropriate</a>, Phineas and Ferb can also be guilty of the act. Some adult watchers of the show have already posted on social media about some scenes that allegedly had 'double meaning,' but Disney hasn't released a statement to address the complaints.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>From Sitcoms To Disney Films, Pat Morita Starred In So Much More Than Just The Karate Kid</a></span></p><p>However, according to Dan Povenmire, one of the two creators of Phineas of Ferb, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the real reason why they suddenly canceled the show is that they wanted to go strong</a>. In a Blog written by Walt Disney company expert Jim Hill, he mentions that Dan explained, "And we [the creators] just didn't want that to be the case with Phineas and Ferb. We didn't want our show to be one of those that wore out its welcome. We wanted to go out strong. Shut down production while people were still fond of the show and its characters."</p><h2 id=what-is-the-true-meaning-behind-phineas-and-ferb>What Is The True Meaning Behind Phineas And Ferb?</h2><p>There are a lot of <a href=#>Phineas and Ferb fan theories, including one questioning if Doofenshmirtz is Phineas' Dad</a>. However, most theories revolve around the true meaning behind the characters in the Phineas and Ferb show. One of the most famous Wiki fan theories is that Candace Flynn is mentally ill because of all the high school trauma she had gone through, and Phineas and Ferb are not real and are just part of her imagination.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many fans consider this accurate because Candace always seems to get upset about Phineas and Ferb's daily summer activity every episode. Candace, Ferb, and Phineas' parents would usually ignore Candace when she would tell their mom or dad about her brothers' outrageous schemes. It could be that their parents are ignoring her because it's all in her imagination, and there are no true Phineas and Ferb after all.</p><h2 id=is-phineas-and-ferb-coming-back-in-2022>Is Phineas And Ferb Coming Back In 2022?</h2><p>With how Dan Povenmire has announced the finality of Phineas and Ferb after four seasons, it is unlikely for Disney to allow a comeback for the cartoon show. Since they want to end the show on a good note, opening it up to the public could ruin the positive end they already have.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition, the voice actors for the main characters, Phineas, Ferb, Candace, Isabella, and Baljeet, have already moved on. <a href=#>Ashley Tisdale, the voice actress for Candace Flynn in the series, is now a mother to her one-year-old daughter Jupiter</a>. After being the voice actor for Ferb, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomas Brodie-Sangster has also finished being part of the Game of Thrones series. </a>Alyson Stoner, who voices Isabella, focuses now on her music.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Is Ashley Tisdaleâ€™s Husband, Christopher French?</a></span></p><p>Considering that the last time they voice-acted their roles was less than a decade ago, the actors themselves have grown out from their parts in Phineas and Ferb.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=will-there-be-another-phineas-and-ferb-series>Will There Be Another Phineas And Ferb Series?</h2><p>It is unlikely that Phineas and Ferb will have a new season, but fans speculate there will be a reboot soon. Since Dan Povenmire is now active on TikTok, where he answers Phineas and Ferb fans' questions about the cartoon show, he is proving that he still cares about the show as much as his fans do.</p><p>A <a href=#>Reddit fan theory</a> has gone viral wherein a fan thinks that the Phineas and Ferb 2020 movie Candace Against The Universe was a way for Disney to test out the waters for their plans. Once they believe Phineas and Ferb are still relatively famous, they could release a limited number of episodes as their reboot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-dan-povenmire-39-s-new-show>What Is Dan Povenmire's New Show?</h2><p>Although Dan Povenmire has left Phineas and Ferb fans hanging, he did not stop creating cartoon shows with similar animation and cartoon designs as the former.</p><p>Hamster and Gretel, Dan's new show, is coming out in the summer of 2022 and features a story of two teenagers named Kevin and Gretel, who have a pet hamster that shares a superpower with Gretel. Fans think Gretel is significantly similar to Candace Flynn in terms of facial features as they both have blonde hair with strong personalities.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Say These Are The Best Cartoon Network Classics</a></span></p><p>Another good news is that Dan Povenmire confirmed that Hamster and Gretel, and Phineas and Ferb share the same cartoon universe. That is why fans could hopefully see a cameo from Phineas and Ferb in the future episodes of Hamster and Gretel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>These â€˜80s Cartoon Characters Would Be Canceled In 2022</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdqbWmxYysq6iooJqxbrnApKCnn12ltaq6xJqqZpmemXqnsdGbZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-top-10-most-unique-nightclubs-in-the-world.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Top 10 Most Unique Nightclubs in the World">&larr;
