Among those that fans are eager to see is the third installment to the Guardians of the Galaxy films.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything Zoe Saldana Has Said About Playing Gamora</a></span></p><p>And while many expect to see all of the&nbsp;principal&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy characters return (<a href=#>with Thor in tow</a>), it seems that director James Gunn is hinting otherwise. In fact, a recent post suggests that Zoe Saldana’s Gamora will not be joining her fellow Guardians this time around.</p><h2 id=marvel-has-big-plans-for-guardians-of-the-galaxy>Marvel Has Big Plans For Guardians Of The Galaxy</h2><p>It’s been several years since the last Guardians of the Galaxy film was released and it seems that Marvel is determined to make up for it in a big way. Aside from releasing Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, Marvel Studios also announced that it was coming out with The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special in 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The plans were revealed following Marvel decision to rehire James Gunn. The director was fired due to a series of controversial tweets that he made several years back. With Gunn out (and directing Suicide Squad for DC), it also seemed that original Guardians cast would never be complete again. For starters, actor Dave Bautista, who has been playing Drax in the first two Guardians installments and other MCU films, has made it clear that he would leave Marvel if Gunn would not be returning. Criticizing Disney, that actor even tweeted that it was “pretty nauseating to work for someone who’d empower a smear campaign by fascists.” The actor also stated, “I will do what Im [sic] legally obligated to do but @Guardians without @JamesGunn is not what I signed up for.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Forgotten Facts About Gamora's Childhood (Before Thanos)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Marvel brought Gunn back, however, it seems all that is now water under the bridge. In fact, with Marvel boss Kevin Feige was asked if they would move to recast Bautista had he left, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he told IGN</a>, “We'll never know. We'll never know. We'll never need to worry about it.” On the other hand, a recent tweet from Gunn is giving fans another cause for worry.</p><h2 id=what-did-james-gunn-say-that-got-fans-confused>What Did James Gunn Say That Got Fans Confused?</h2><p>Just recently, Gunn took to Twitter to confirm that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is set to be released on May 5, 2023. Many celebrated the announcement, with Star-Lord himself, Chris Pratt, jokingly remarking, “I can’t wait! I loved the first two!!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the same time, the post also prompted follow-up questions from fans. One even asked for casting news. In response, Gunn replied, “Star-Lord is @prattprattpratt, Drax is @DaveBautista, Mantis is @PomKlementieff, Nebula is @karengillan, and Kraglin is @seangunn. There you go!” And while the response is helpful, fans also can’t help but notice that he left out a key cast member, specifically Saldana.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some were also under the impression that Saldana won’t be joining the movie after what happened in Avengers: Endgame. As fans may recall, a past version of Gamora joined in the final fight against Thanos (Josh Brolin). However, after they defeated him (and after Robert Downey, Jr.’s Tony Stark dies), she disappears. It also seemed that Gamora took off on her own since the rest of the Guardians couldn’t find her when they were preparing to leave.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>‘Guardians Of The Galaxy’ Writer James Gunn Says Gamora’s Death Wasn’t Planned</a></span></p><p>Despite this, however, fans can be relieved to learn that Gamora will be appearing in the upcoming installment. Saldana herself had confirmed as much soon after Disney announcement that Gunn was back. “I’m really excited, and I’m proud of Bob Iger and Alan Horn for stepping up and making a decision to reinstate James Gunn,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the actress told Variety in 2019</a>. “And obviously, I’m happy to have my captain back on board because we were panicking. No other person can be like James Gunn for ‘Guardians.'”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=here-s-what-zoe-saldana-has-said-about-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3>Here’s What Zoe Saldana Has Said About Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3</h2><p>Having been portraying Gamora since 2014, Saldana probably knows more about this Marvel character than anyone else. And with the recent developments surrounding Gamora, the actress also thinks that now would be a good time to show a different side of her.</p><p>“There’s a part of me that wants her to go back. Find her way back to the Guardians,” Saldana explained while attending the ACE Comic-Con in Seattle back in 2019. “But there’s also a part of me that wants to explore a bad Gamora. I’ve never seen that and she’s, you know, she’s considered the most lethal assassin. The most lethal woman in the galaxy. So I would want to see what that wrath looks like, also because it would just give me layers to sort of work on. But yeah, I want her to get back to the Guardians.”</p><p>It seems all is well with the MCU and the Guardians. And more importantly, the gang will be complete when they go on a new adventure in just a couple of years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:<a href=#> James Gunn Denies Casting Rumors For Adam Warlock In ‘Guardians of the Galaxy 3’</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmnZqmo2LBqbXNpGSzp5ViwKK4w5qlmmWnpLu1ecGeZKKmXZzCor7Dopinq12ks27Ax55koJmclsW6eZJo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jeremy-stenberg-net-worth-therichest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jeremy Stenberg Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr;
