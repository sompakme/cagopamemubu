However, landing a lead role can also lead to being on a show that falls flat on its face.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Heather Graham</a> has been a mainstay in Hollywood for years, and people know her best from her biggest hits. During the 2000s, Graham starred on a show that was cancelled after a single episode.</p><p>Let's take a look and see what happened.</p><h2 id=heather-graham-has-starred-in-many-hit-projects>Heather Graham Has Starred In Many Hit Projects</h2><p>In the 1980s, Heather Graham began her time working in the world of film, and even though it would take some time to become a huge name, the performer stuck it out and wound up finding plenty of success along the way.</p><p>Graham could have had a breakout role in Heathers early on, but she missed the boat in the 80s.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reflecting on this</a>, Graham said, "I would have loved to have been in it. My family was very strict. I was living at home, and they weren’t in favor of me doing it, so I didn’t get to do it. I was going to play one of the Heathers. But it’s fun that they wanted me to be in it. At that point in my life, it was a great vote of confidence."</p><p>After License to Drive earned her some exposure in the 80s, Graham would continue chasing her big-screen dreams in the 90s. During that decade she would appear in a string of movies, though she was still looking for a breakout role. 1997's Boogie Nights was just what her career needed, and the success of the film thrust Graham into the spotlight.</p><p>In the years that followed, Graham would continue finding success on the big screen. She has been in movies like Scream 2, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, From Hell, The Hangover, and more.</p><p>As great as she has been in movies, Graham has done plenty of television work, as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Rejoice At 'Manifest' Being Saved From Cancellation And Getting Its Final Season</a></span></p><h2 id=her-television-work-led-to-her-own-show>Her Television Work Led To Her Own Show</h2><p>Having made her television debut on Growin Pains all the way back in 1987, Heather Graham had been putting in work to eventually get a starring vehicle on the small screen. During the 80s, the actress would also get to appear on Student Exchange, and she would continue her television acting into the 90s.</p><p>In the 90s, fans would have the chance to catch Graham on shows like Twin Peaks, Fallen Angels, The Outer Limits, and Fantasy Island. These were always in guest spots, but they still gave the actress an opportunity to perform for audiences at home and to get some impressive credits under her belt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After breaking out in film during the latter part of the 90s, Graham would land some larger television roles during the 2000s. Shows like Sex and the City, Arrested Development, and Scrubs all gave Graham a chance to shine. In fact, her time on Scrubs lasted for a total of 9 episodes from 2004 to 2005.</p><p>The following year, Graham was cast as the lead on a sitcom that received the green light from ABC. Instead of becoming a smash hit, this show wound up netting a unique and unfavorable distinction.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Full Story Behind Tim Burton's Canceled Batman Musical</a></span></p><h2 id=39-emily-39-s-reasons-why-not-39-was-cancelled-after-one-episode>'Emily's Reasons Why Not' Was Cancelled After One Episode</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/B13002FF-67B5-4C4F-9F0A-A50BC96A3069.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unbelievably, Emily's Reasons Why Not has the rare distinction of being a show that was canceled after airing just one episode. Not one full season, just one episode. This news came as quite a shock to fans, as most shows will at least get to stumble through a single season before getting axed.</p><p>The show was not able to conjure up the ratings that the network was hoping for, and Graham herself was not earning praise for her performance. Factor in the show being considered a lesser version of Sex and the City and that many found the lead character unlikable, and you have yourself a perfect storm for cancellation.</p><p>Instead of airing the second episode, a rerun episode of The Bachelor aired instead.</p><p>According to executive producer, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gavin Polone</a>, "That’s the television business. When the audience stays away, in this super-competitive environment, quick decisions are made.”</p><p>Just like that, Emily's Reasons Why Not was nothing more than a footnote in history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason ‘Ed, Edd N Eddy’ Was Canceled</a></span></p><p>Sometimes, a show will get axed early on but still leave a huge impression on its audience, but this show has been completely forgotten about by the vast majority of people. Those that do remember it mainly remember it lasting for just a single episode.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Emma Stone Was Almost Cancelled For Starring In This Role</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroaGjYrWmrdOhnKtll6euqa3MZqqirJOkum7DwKxknJmemLKtuMSdZJqepJq%2FbrvNnmSeqJmovKWxjJ6koqSpqHqzscCspqerXay1unnNqKtmmpGYtaa4zqtkq52iqru0ew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tina-fey-suffers-nip-slip-wardrobe-malfunction-on-stage-at-emmys-2013.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tina Fey Suffers Nip Slip, Wardrobe Malfunction on Stage at Emmys 2013">&larr;
