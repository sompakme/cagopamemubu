Fans are asking questions like <a href=#>why wasn't David Schwimmer credited as Russ</a>, or <a href=#>who took Monica's place as an extra during a certain scene</a>. Fans continue to ask questions about certain Easter eggs and in this article, that's exactly what we're going to look at, taking a look back at an unscripted moment that became something iconic. <span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>The One 'Friends' Episode Matthew Perry Refused To Film</a></span>The moment took place during the fourth season, featuring Chandler and Rachel. Somehow, Aniston was able to keep her cool, even though she was surely breaking on the inside.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-was-jennifer-aniston-holding-in-her-laugh-on-friends>Why Was Jennifer Aniston Holding In Her Laugh On 'Friends'?</h2><p>The blooper-reel is truly something to behold when it comes to 'Friends'. It really shows how close the cast was, as they weren't afraid to burst into laughter during certain scenes.</p><p>In addition, 'Friends' featured several unscripted moments that were left in the show. One that comes to mind is when the fake Ross was thrown down the stairs. Aniston was completely shocked by it and as it turns out, she wasn't told about the flying dummy. Her reaction is that much more hilarious knowing she wasn't aware.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Who Was Courteney Cox's Favorite Guest-Star Love Interest On 'Friends'?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition, there were several Chandler Bing moments that the actor completely improvised himself. He was truly the master at that, even until the last episode when he says, "where," that line was also completely unscripted.</p><p>Of course, the cast got back together for the reunion and according to Aniston, <a href=#>it wasn't easy for her, as she was fueled with emotions.</a></p><p>"It was all very jarring and, of course, you've got cameras everywhere, and I'm already a little emotionally accessible, I guess you could say," she said. "I had to walk out at certain points. I don't know how they cut around it."</p><p>Although being back on-set was hard, looking back at the moments really wasn't, especially this improvised part that took place between herself and Matthew Perry.</p><h2 id=the-moment-between-matthew-perry-and-jennifer-aniston-took-place-in-the-one-with-the-cuffs>The Moment Between Matthew Perry And Jennifer Aniston Took Place In 'The One With The Cuffs'</h2><p>During season 4, episode 3 was entitled 'The One with the Cuffs'. It aired in October of 1997 and it was truly hilarious, featuring the main plot, Chandler handcuffed to Rachel's boss' desk.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once Rachel find out about the moment, things start to unravel, especially when she frees Chandler of the desk. Rachel realizes she made a mistake, so she cuffs Chandler onto the filing cabinet. It was at that moment that the hilarious and unscripted moment would take place, showing the cabinet opening on Chandler's head.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Matthew Perry Completely Lost It When Matt LeBlanc Messed Up His Line On 'Friends'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, being the professional that he is, Matthew Perry completely sold the scene, as part of the show. His reaction was completely hilarious, and it is a wonder how he did not break, given how hard that cabinet hit the back of his head. As for Aniston, things were not easy for the actress, as she clearly had to cover up her mouth, looking as though she was about to burst into laughter.</p><p>Aniston was able to hold it together and thankfully, the scene cut shortly after. Fans almost missed out on a classic moment between the two had either one broke.</p><h2 id=what-did-the-fans-think-of-the-moment>What Did The Fans Think Of The Moment?</h2><p>It truly was an iconic unscripted moment and looking back, fans love the scene that much more knowing that it was completely unscripted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With over 65K views on YouTube, here's what the top comments had to say.</p><p>"Considering that was an accident credit Matthew for staying in character and adding it to the moment."</p><p>"This scene wasn't scripted. The drawer was never meant to slam into his head so they went with it. Matt actually slammed his head hard against a metal drawer."</p><p>"Matthew Perry is so funny you must have me confused with the amazing Chandler the whole nine yards hilarious when he runs into the sliding glass door and when you runs into Michael Duncan's chest I was peeing my pants."</p><p>"Knowing it was an accident makes bud face so much better."</p><p>An iconic scene and one that was made that much better given how organic it truly was. It is remarkable how we're still talking about the show and such scenes, despite the fact that it aired over two decades ago. A true classic.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Matt LeBlanc Initially Refused To Film This ‘Friends’ Storyline</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqaenrOmvoyapaKrpKS7bsHNrJqroaCpsqV5xaugnqaUqHquu8yepa1n</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jim-lee-net-worth-therichest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jim Lee Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr;
