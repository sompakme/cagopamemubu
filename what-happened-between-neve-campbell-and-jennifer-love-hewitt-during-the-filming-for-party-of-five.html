However, others aren't afraid to make their feelings about one another known publicly, through a variety of ways.</p><p>Many celebrities are also able to get along with one another after working together. Some might remain friends for years, even lifetimes.</p><p>It seems Jennifer Love Hewitt had nothing but praise for her former Party of Five co-star, Neve Campbell, about their time together on set, even years after the show had finished filming.</p><p>According to Yahoo!, during an Access Hollywood interview, a video message from her former co-star, Jennifer Love Hewitt, was shared with her. In the video, the I Know What You did Last Summer actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">discusses her time on the set with Campbell</a>.</p><p>She stated, "She's just so talented, um, and such a beautiful person, it was just really fun for me as a teenager to be around a woman like that."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She continued, "And so I just wish her well, and I wanted to say hi."

According to the article, apparently the host asked the former co-stars which cast mate "hooked up with fans the most".</p><p>Reportedly, "Wolf had exactly zero hesitation in naming Jennifer Love Hewitt, while Campbell appeared shocked."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Has Jennifer Love Hewitt Been Up To Since The 2000s</a></span></p><p>However, according to the Daily Mail, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wolf had to quickly take back those remarks</a>.

It's not always because they feuded or parted on bad terms, many simply go in different directions creatively and might lose touch with former co-stars.</p><p>However, sometimes celebrities <a href=#>part on bad terms</a>, ending things quietly or sometimes with public, famous feuds. With former Party of Five co-stars Neve Campbell and Jennifer Love Hewitt, it seems the two parted on good terms, and have continued to have nothing but genuine affection and respect for one another.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Neve Campbell Won't Return For 'Scream 6'</a></span></p><p>According to a Stuff.co article from 2010, when Neve Campbell was mistaken for Jennifer Love Hewitt, the actor seemed to have no problem with the mix-up. She also seemed glad about the comparison, and has described Jennifer Love Hewitt as "a beautiful girl".</p><p>This, combined with the kind message from the Ghost Whisperer actor to Campbell during her Access Hollywood interview seems to indicate a consistent friendship and two actors who truly respect each other.</p><p>It seems even though the two might not often speak because of the different directions their lives have taken, they still seem to have a genuine affection for one another.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmppWrsm6vwKanm52coXqiusNmoZ6mnp6zpr6MpaavnV2dsri1061kqKZdpa6zwNhmpp9llp7Dpns%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-natalie-gauvreau-new-boyfriend-50-cent-alleged-girlfriend-age-and-instagram-bio.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Natalie Gauvreau New Boyfriend? 50 Cent Alleged Girlfriend Age and Instagram Bio">&larr;
