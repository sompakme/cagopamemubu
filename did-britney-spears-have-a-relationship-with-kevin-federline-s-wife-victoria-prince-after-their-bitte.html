She is credited as the original pop princess and has amassed an adoring legion of fans.</p><p>Despite her accomplishments and fame, Spears has also had her share of troubles. She has gone through public breakdowns and a tumultuous court battle with her parents, whom she has claimed have manipulated and stolen from her.</p><p>One of Britney Spears' biggest scandals was her speedy marriage and divorce to Kevin Federline. The couple share two children, whom Spears is estranged from. Spears and Federline have not always seen eye to eye, and their dirty laundry has often been aired in public. Not long after their divorce, Federline remarried to Victoria Prince. The union left fans wondering if Spears ever got along with her ex-husband's wife.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-britney-spears-and-kevin-federline-meet>How Did Britney Spears And Kevin Federline Meet?</h2><p>Early in her career as a pop superstar, Britney Spears got married. It wasn't to Kevin Federline, at least not then. It was first to her childhood friend Jason Alexander. While Spears had been dating Alexander for a while, friends, family, and fans were still shocked when news broke that the two had married.</p><p>Both of them were very young at the time, and the wedding was an elopement held at a Las Vegas chapel. The speedy marriage only lasted a few months, with Spears later citing the union as a rebellious decision. Alexander had a slightly different view of their nuptials as he stated that he genuinely loved Spears but admitted that they got married on a whim.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/britney-spears.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not long after Britney Spears' marriage and relationship with Jason Alexander ended, she met and fell in love with Kevin Federline, also known by his nickname of K-Fed. Federline was a success in his own right; he was an actor, model, and DJ when he first met Spears.</p><p>While Britney Spears took center stage in her sold-out concerts worldwide, Kevin Federline took a more subdued role as a backup dancer for several acts, such as Destiny's Child, Michael Jackson, and Spears' ex-boyfriend Justin Timberlake.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#> Kevin Federline Speaks Out Amid Britney Spears And Sam Asghari Divorce</a></span></p><p>In a report by US Weekly, Federline once recounted how he met his then-wife Spears: "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I met her at a club</a> in Hollywood, Joseph's. Our eyes met, and that was it. We just hit it off right away. I was madly in love with her. Everything just seemed so right. I didn't see it as too fast or too slow."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/kevin-federline-net-worth-britney-spears.jpg><p>Like her quick and private wedding with Jason Alexander months earlier, Britney Spears rather hastily married Kevin Federline. The union was held at a private residence in Studio City, California, in front of a close circle of friends and family who had only learned of the nuptials hours before it took place.</p><h2 id=britney-spears-39-and-kevin-federline-39-s-messy-divorce>Britney Spears' And Kevin Federline's Messy Divorce</h2><p>Although Federline had two children in a previous relationship with actress Shar Jackson, Spears had none. Still, the talented pop star often spoke in the media about how she desired to become a mom.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar49228981-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not long into their marriage, Britney Spears gave birth to their first child, Sean Preston, and then Jayden James. The marriage ended not long after Spears gave birth to her second child, with Spears ultimately ending their relationship.</p><p>Reportedly, the split was because Spears could not take Federline's bad boy persona and lifestyle; she felt it had come between their marriage and was negatively affecting their children.</p><p>According to a source cited by People Magazine, Spears had expressed that: "[It] was her last straw. He [Federline] said, 'I have to go to Vegas.' He didn't have to go to Vegas. He uses any excuse to party. She <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said, 'I've had enough</a>.'"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/untitled-design-49.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Britney Spears' and Kevin Federline's divorce then took a drastic turn. Spears had wanted joint custody of their children, but Federline resisted at every turn. He made several claims that Spears was an unfit parent and cited mental illness as her biggest issue.</p><p>After Britney Spears had several stints in rehab, Federline was awarded custody of their children. Shortly after the ruling, Spears' was put under a conservatorship headed by her father and she was granted only occasional vising rights with her children.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Kevin Federline Has Sole Custody Of His Kids With Britney Spears</a></span></p><p>NBC News reported on a message Spears wrote on Instagram to her millions of followers concerning her conservatorship and relationship with her two children:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I've tried to my best at being the best person I can be...to be held hostage in homes under nurses and bulls--t.
