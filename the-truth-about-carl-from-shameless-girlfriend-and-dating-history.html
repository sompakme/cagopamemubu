However, most of the conversation around the show at the time revolved around stars William H. Macy and Emmy Rossum. While that made sense given that both of those actors are extremely talented and famous, Shameless’ cast was choked full of wonderful actors. Thankfully, Shameless fans quickly learned how talented the show’s cast truly was.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Shameless always was imbued with an us versus the world kind of energy, most of the show’s fans really became invested in its many main characters. On top of that, everyone who starred in Shameless developed a devoted following as well which is why so many people care about <a href=#>Emma Kenney's love Life</a>. Additionally, a lot of people have been paying attention to <a href=#>what Carl actor Ethan Cutkosky has been up to since Shameless ended</a>. For example, there has been a lot of interest in Cutkosky's dating history.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How William H. Macy Really Felt About Emmy Rossum Leaving 'Shameless'</a></span></p><h2 id=ethan-cutkosky-rsquo-s-love-life>Ethan Cutkosky’s Love Life</h2><p>For longtime Shameless fans, there are a couple of reasons to think that Ethan Cutkosky is a lot older than he is. First off, Cutkosky starred in Shameless from 2011 until 2021 and since he has been in the public eye that long, it is easy to overestimate his age. On top of that, Cutkosky’s Shameless character was a lot more mature than most kids his age so he always seemed older. Despite the perception of him, Ethan Cutkosky still is only 22-years-old as of this writing according to Wikipedia.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In this day and age, it is extremely common for people in their early-20s to be dating around to have fun and figure out what they want in a partner. On top of that, it is noteworthy that most young stars seem to jump in and out of relationships even quicker than their non-famous peers. Despite all of that, whodatedwho.com reports that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ethan Cutkosky has been dating a young woman named Brielle Barbusca since 2015</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, the only people who know what goes on in a relationship are the people involved. As a result, it would be foolish for anyone to make assumptions about Ethan Cutkosky and Brielle Barbusca’s relationship. That said, a lot of Cutkosky’s fans raised their eyebrows when Barbusca scrubbed every photo of her with Ethan from her social media. Still, there haven’t been any actual reports of a breakup and it is entirely possible that Barbusca simply decided to keep her relationship with Cutkosky more private.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here Are All The 'Shameless' Actors Ranked From Poorest To Richest</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-ethan-cutkosky-rsquo-s-reported-girlfriend-brielle-barbusca>Who Is Ethan Cutkosky’s Reported Girlfriend Brielle Barbusca?</h2><p>For anyone who keeps up with celebrity gossip, it can be easy to think that stars solely date other celebrities. However, even though it is very common for celebrities to date one another, there also are many examples of <a href=#>famous people who’ve gotten romantically involved with regular people</a>. When it comes to Ethan Cutkosky’s dating life, his reported longtime girlfriend falls in between those two categories as she isn’t famous per se but she works in the entertainment business.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As of the time of this writing, Brielle Barbusca hasn’t landed the kind of role that could turn her into a star. That said, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Barbusca has an impressive filmography already</a>. For example, Barbusca has appeared in episodes of several notable shows including Shameless, Modern Family, Bones, Young Sheldon, Scandal, and The Mindy Project. Barbusca also is set to have a notable role in an upcoming thriller film titled Don’t Log Off.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Dream Come True: 15 Celebs Who Are Open To Dating Their Fans</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-are-shameless-rsquo-other-stars-dating>Who Are Shameless’ Other Stars Dating?</h2><p>During Shameless’ eleven-season run, the show featured a long list of actors in starring roles. However, there always will be certain stars who will be most synonymous with Shameless since they made more of an impact on the beloved series. Unsurprisingly, some former Shameless stars reportedly are single as of the time of this writing including Cameron Monaghan, Emma Kenney, and Steve Howey. However, the vast majority of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">most notable Shameless stars are in long-term relationships</a>.</p><p>One of the Shameless stars whose been with the same person for years is Jeremy Allen White who began dating Addison Timlin in 2017, has two kids with her, and got married in 2019. After a past failed marriage, Emmy Rossum married Sam Esmail in 2017 after they started dating in 2013. After Noel Fisher began dating actor Layla Alizada in 2006, they got married in 2017 as well. Then there are at least three Shameless stars who’ve been married for more than twenty years, Shanola Hampton, William H. Macy, and Joan Cusack.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>20 Dark Secrets The Shameless Cast Tried To Hide From Superfans</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiamqqcYrOzu8xmqqGZnZq5pr%2FSZpytoJGjeqTB06SmrKOpYrSqvsufqaKdnpl6pa3ToqWgZZiewLW70bJm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./15-celebrities-that-hugh-hefner-rejected.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Celebrities That Hugh Hefner Rejected">&larr;
