Kunis has only gotten better with age. The following list ranks just 20 of Mila's best looks over the past two decades. Mila is like a fine wine&nbsp;that has only improved with time and is considered to be one of the most fashionable women in the world right now.</p><h2 id=this-stunning-purple-gown-at-the-queen-of-oz-premiere>This Stunning Purple Gown At The Queen Of Oz Premiere</h2><p>It's hard to find any faults with the outfit that Mila opted to wear for the Moscow premiere of Oz The Great And Powerful back in 2013. Even though Mila wasn't the main star of the movie, something that she had probably become accustomed to at that point, it seems that she was still up for making an effort for every screening of the movie.</p><p>Here she is seen wearing a stunning Atelier Versace dress, which features a thigh-high slit&nbsp;that manages to show off the fact that she is wearing Christian Louboutin shoes. This was Walt Disney's premiere of the movie so it seems that Mila decided to go for a look that was seen as child-friendly as well. The minimal makeup and the fact that her hair is scraped to one side are definitely two of the best things about this look.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=this-lacy-white-button-up-dress>This Lacy White Button-Up Dress</h2><p>Back in 2013, Mila Kunis was named Gemfield's&nbsp;global brand ambassador and became the face of their advertising campaign, something that definitely boosted their profile. The company has become best known for their jewellery, which includes some impressive rubies and emeralds. Because of the new campaign and the fact that Mila was named as a new ambassador, the company decided to throw Mila her own party.</p><p>Mila is seen above attending the Gemfields And W Magazine Celebrate The Launch Of Gemfields' New Brand Ambassador Mila Kunis event, where she decided to wear Elie Saab, the same woman who designed her show-stopping Oscars dress in 2011. The white lace is classy and fashion-forward, especially since she paired the effortless look with flat white pumps. The lack of noticeable jewellery at the launch of a jewellery event was definitely a bold choice by the actress.</p><h2 id=this-gorgeous-black-dress-at-the-premiere-for-jupiter-ascending>This Gorgeous Black Dress At The Premiere For Jupiter Ascending</h2><p>Mila Kunis starred alongside <a href=#>Channing Tatum</a> in Jupiter Ascending back in 2015 and it seems that she was definitely something out of this world at the Los Angeles premiere of her movie back in February of that year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mila obviously opted to arrive in style as she is seen wearing a flowing, figure-hugging Dolce and Gabbana dress as well as some beautiful lace detailed heels. In the movie, Kunis plays a character called Jupiter Jones who was unhappy with her job until Tatum's character comes along. It's hard to imagine Kunis not being happy with her regular job when it seems that she is able to attend movie premieres dressed to the nines and state that it is all part of her job. The strapless dress allows the actress to show off her shoulders, while this time she has opted to wear her hair down, which only adds to the overall look.</p><h2 id=these-metallic-shorts-are-amazing>These Metallic Shorts Are Amazing</h2><p>Over the past few years, Mila has been able to show off her best features in some of the films that she has been part of, but she doesn't often have the chance to&nbsp;wear shorter dresses&nbsp;on the red carpet. It seems that back in 2012 in a film party in Las Vegas, Mila was able to skip the long gown in favor of&nbsp;these metallic 3.1 Phillip Lim shorts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Impressively, Mila hasn't decided to match her outfit based on colour as she has gone for some pale pink suede heels, which go well with her pink coloured shirt and black blazer. Her beautifully curled hair looks well placed here as well. Mila put together quite a risky outfit here that could have completely failed in front of some critics, but fashion is all about risks and this one definitely paid off for the actress.</p><h2 id=this-classy-christian-dior-ensemble>This Classy Christian Dior Ensemble</h2><p>How apt that Mila turned up looking so fashionable for a fashion show back in 2011. Here she is pictured wearing head-to-toe in Christian Dior as she arrived for&nbsp;the Dior Fall/Winter 2012/2013 Fashion Show during Paris Fashion Week a few years ago. It seems that Kunis has realized that white is a colour that works for her.&nbsp;She managed to work the long back blazer on top of a pale pink lace dress.</p><p>Even though she has paired the outfit with a snakeskin clutch that is a completely different colour, it still manages to pair the outfit together. Her hair looks shiny and straight; this simple look was the best choice for this casual looking outfit for the fashion show. Maybe this is how Mila gets a lot of her fashion tips and they definitely seem to be working out well for her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=this-stunning-princess-like-gown>This Stunning Princess-Like Gown</h2><p>Mila Kunis was cast as the witch Theodora in fantasy adventure&nbsp;Oz The Great and Powerful back in 2013. It seems that playing a witch onscreen led to quite a magical display at the premiere of the movie a few months later. Mila is pictured wearing&nbsp;Dolce & Gabbana at the Los Angeles premiere of a movie that many thought would do much better at the box office than it actually did.</p><p>This outfit wouldn't look out of place on the set of one of Mila's older films, Black Swan. This time Mila decided to pair her flowing white outfit with some quite bold dark purple earrings. Even her silver heels seem to fit perfectly with this look. She once again stunned the crowds as she walked the red carpet looking every inch the star that she has become.</p><h2 id=this-figure-flattering-white-lace-dress>This Figure-Flattering White Lace Dress</h2><p>Mila is someone who has been able to dress up and walk red carpets for most of her career, which could be why she decided to go for quite a sophisticated look when she was seen at the premiere of Third Person back in 2013.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The film premiered as part of the Toronto film festival in the fall of 2013 and it seems that Mila decided to go for a beautiful look that paired her patterned white dress with snakeskin shoes. At this point in 2013, snakeskin was all the rage on the red carpet and it seems that Mila was trying to do her part by not being too over-the-top about the trend. This looks screamed sophisticated and showed just how much Mila's style has evolved over the past few years. Just when we thought Mila couldn't top herself, she once again surprised&nbsp;all the critics with this stunning ensemble.</p><h2 id=this-perfect-little-black-dress>This Perfect Little Black Dress</h2><p>Over the years, many people have asked the question as to whether or not you are really a star if you haven't rocked a little black dress. As long as fashion has been documented, the go-to outfit for every woman is their little black dress and it seems that Mila decided to finally pull hers out back in 2010 when she attended The Writers Guild Awards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The look is one that has been made a classic and everyone loves it when someone brings in a new spin on a classic. Mila modelled the cut-out short dress perfectly, and she decided to pair it with shiny black block heels. Even her black clutch purse matched the outfit. Mila was going all business at the awards that year. It's simple but it is also a head-turner; it seems that sometimes you don't have to take risks to turn heads.&nbsp;Take note, <a href=#>Miley Cyrus!</a></p><h2 id=this-sparkly-blazer>This Sparkly Blazer</h2><p>Mila is someone who has rubbed shoulders with some of the biggest stars in the business so it's obvious that at some point she was going to be invited to some huge parties in Beverly Hills. Mila is shown above attending a party in California where she's decided to pair a&nbsp;L'Agence blazer with a white shirt and simple separates.</p><p>Mila doesn't just know how to dress up; she also knows how to dress down as well. She seems to always know how to pair the right things together. The tight jeans and shiny black heels seem to work well together as Mila once again stole the show at a party she wasn't even hosting. Mila&nbsp;did not decide to curl or put her hair up here either.&nbsp;Instead, she went&nbsp;for the simple look, which works very well for her as she once again looks like she's thrown together a stunning look.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=this-show-stopping-red-dress-at-the-friends-with-benefits-premiere>This Show-Stopping Red Dress At The Friends With Benefits Premiere</h2><p>One of Mila's biggest movies to date was when she appeared alongside <a href=#>Justin Timberlake </a>in Friends With Benefits back in 2011. The story follows two friends who try to make a purely physical relationship work out without attaching feelings, but it is not as easy as they thought it would be, something that was very topical at that time.</p><p>Mila was the star of the movie so it was obvious that she would have all eyes on her at the premiere of the movie in New York in the summer of 2011. Mila is seen above wearing a dress designed by&nbsp;Lanvin, which she paired&nbsp;with some beautiful black heels. The hair down and minimal jewellery look makes it seem as though Mila has tried not to overdo it on the red carpet, but she still managed to walk away with many critics claiming that this was one of her best looks. It seems that sometimes less really is more.</p><h2 id=this-glam-sparkly-dress>This&nbsp;Glam Sparkly Dress</h2><p>After more than two decades in the spotlight, Mila has become accustomed to dressing up and showing off her incredible fashion sense. The actress always knows the right time to dress up in a full-length gown and when to dial it down and show off her legs in a short sparkly number.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The VH1 Rock Honors in 2008, where the company honoured The Who, was the perfect place for Mila to show off her&nbsp;sassy side. She had recently been part of one of her biggest films called Forgetting Sarah Marshall and it seems that Mila wanted to have a little bit of fun on the red carpet. She is seen here in a floaty, short dress that she paired with black low heels. She has also tied her hair back and curled her&nbsp;hair, which&nbsp;gave the overall look one of elegance.</p><h2 id=this-perfectly-tailored-white-pantsuit>This Perfectly Tailored White Pantsuit</h2><p>Suits are something that more and more women have been wearing as&nbsp;a fashion statement over the past few years, but while many women have been wearing them without a shirt underneath or as a way to show off their masculine side, it seems Mila used it to show off just how feminine she really is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mila is seen here rocking a Boca Negra suit that she has decided to pair with&nbsp;Christian Louboutin shoes and while the outfit isn't usually one that would work, Mila looks exceptionally stylish and so feminine. The understated makeup and the black clutch bag seem to bring the outfit together as it seems that Mila truly became a style icon when she was spotted rocking this stunning white pantsuit. It takes someone really special to be able to make an outfit like this work and it seems that Mila definitely was that someone.</p><h2 id=this-one-shouldered-sassy-dress>This One-Shouldered Sassy Dress</h2><p>Mila was used to walking red carpets by 2010 after years of practice.&nbsp;She looked absolutely incredible at the premiere of The Book of Eli in January of that year. Mila portrayed the role of&nbsp;Solara in the post-apocalyptic western style film that also starred <a href=#>Denzel Washington</a> and<a href=#> Gary Oldman</a>.</p><p>It was a role that Mila really looked comfortable in and she looked even more comfortable at the premiere. She showed off her&nbsp;best features in the one-strap dress that allowed her shoulders to be the main focus of the outfit. The dangling earrings were perfect with the dress since her hair was tied back and it pulled the focus from her face. This is a beautiful look that seems like something that Mila threw together casually.&nbsp;However, it actually turned into something stunning, which isn't that much of a surprise.&nbsp;It seems that Mila can make any look flawless.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=this-elegant-black-jumpsuit>This Elegant Black Jumpsuit</h2><p>Jumpsuits don't look great on just anyone, but it seems that Mila knows exactly how to rock one as she is showing off here at The White House Correspondents Association dinner back in 2011. Kunis was always an avid supporter of the Democratic Party and of <a href=#>Barack Obama</a> and even spoke out about her dislike of the Republican Party and the way they treated women.</p><p>Mila has become a role model over the past decade and it seems that the way she spoke out about this was something that earned her a lot of backing from her loyal fanbase. Mila looked absolutely stunning as she attended the dinner, which is usually seen as a night of joke fuelled fun and is often attended by the President of the United States.</p><h2 id=this-incredible-one-shouldered-green-gown>This Incredible One-Shouldered Green Gown</h2><p>Green is not usually a colour that many actresses are open to wearing, especially for an event like The Golden Globes, but it seems that Mila couldn't say no to this stunning Vera Wang gown that she wore for the 2011 ceremony, where she picked up the award for best supporting actress for her role alongside <a href=#>Natalie Portman</a> in Black Swan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seems that Black Swan was one of the films that brought Mila to critical acclaim and the public's attention and she knew that it was her chance to stand out at many of the award events that she attended, thanks to her nominations for the film. Mila was on the best-dressed list for many of these events as she showed the early signs of being a fashion icon all those years ago. Seven years and two children later, it seems that Mila is still making waves on the fashion scene.</p><h2 id=this-elegant-white-dress>This Elegant White Dress</h2><p>Mila Kunis received critical acclaim for her role as Lily in The Black Swan&nbsp;alongside Natalie Portman back in 2010.&nbsp;The psychological&nbsp;thriller gained Mila the Premio Marcello Mastroianni&nbsp;for Best Young Actress as well as nominations for the SAG Award and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress. It seems that this was one of the films that finally pushed Mila into the spotlight and she made sure that she went all out for the premiere.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mila is seen above showing off a daring neckline in a stunning white dress that also features a slit up to her knee. Mila looks like she is dressed for an awards ceremony more than a premiere here, but that doesn't make her look any less stunning. She also understatedly matched her black nail polish with her black heels.</p><h2 id=this-bold-red-gown>This Bold Red Gown</h2><p>2011 was a fantastic year for fashion when it comes to Mila Kunis' outfits. She definitely put her name on the map when she arrived at the 17th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards in an incredible multi-layered dress that was designed by the incomparable Alexander McQueen.</p><p>The tie-dye style of the dress is definitely something that allows this dress to stand out above all the other celebrities who attended the event. The fact that Mila lets her hair flow down almost gives it something of a casual look, and makes it the perfect look for her to try out at the SAG Awards. The belt around the middle allows Mila to give the dress some shape rather than it being seen as just a flowing dress and her figure being lost beneath it. She made her way onto every best-dressed list following this event as critics began taking note of her impeccable fashion sense.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=this-funky-sheer-patterned-top-with-a-matching-skirt>This Funky Sheer Patterned&nbsp;Top With A Matching Skirt</h2><p>2011 was definitely a fantastic year for Mila when it came to fashion, especially since she was seen walking the red carpet for Friends with Benefits and attending a number of awards ceremonies because of her nominations for Black Swan.&nbsp;</p><p>Mila is seen here in a&nbsp;fitted grey&nbsp;skirt and shirt as she attends the&nbsp; 5th Annual Guys Choice Awards held at the Sony Pictures Studios, Los Angeles back in 2011. Her&nbsp;beige coloured heels are definitely the perfect thing to pair with this kind of outfit, while her orange clutch is another one of those bold choices that Mila has become known for over the past few decades. It's obvious that Mila always knows exactly what to wear for every event.</p><h2 id=this-figure-hugging-black-dress>This Figure-Hugging Black Dress</h2><p>It seems that it isn't just movie premieres and awards ceremonies that Mila dresses up for; above she is photographed attending an art exhibition in LA in November 2010. Mila is a huge fan of art and it seems that she thought it was worth putting on a fantastic outfit for this event, since she looks incredible in this plunging black dress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The dress is long enough to be elegant and appropriate, but also short enough to show off her best&nbsp;features. Mila's hair is brushed into a side parting&nbsp;and she has decided to tie it back and once again wear long earrings to pull the focus to her face. The minimal jewellery only goes on to add to the overall look of the outfit as she once again looks stunning. It seems that Mila can't go anywhere without being pictured and being seen as a fashion icon.</p><h2 id=her-classic-lilac-academy-awards-outfit>Her Classic Lilac Academy Awards Outfit</h2><p>Mila dazzled back in 2011 when she arrived at the 83rd annual Academy Awards in a romantic looking purple lace gown that was designed by&nbsp;Elie Saab. Mila has always been someone who has been able to show off her best features and it seems that she works hard to ensure that she is always able to turn heads at these kinds of events, something that she definitely does here.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The details of the dress&nbsp;are what definitely set this look apart from many of the dresses and outfits that Mila is seen in throughout this list. She has tied her hair back and her shoulders have become the main focus of this entire look. There is a reason why Mila was once seen as the&nbsp;most stylish women in the world; she knows how to dress to ensure that all of her assets are enhanced.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKypobJwvsCnoqKml2LBqbGMa2dmmpWowW671K2doqyjYrqquMBmoq6mmah6qa3SZpyvnaJixLC%2BzWg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./which-wayans-brother-has-the-highest-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Which Wayans Brother Has The Highest Net Worth?">&larr;
