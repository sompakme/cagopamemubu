The stunning 41-year-old rose to stardom in the late '90s when she landed one of the <a href=#>main roles on the family drama 7th Heaven</a>. These days, she has left many people wondering; <strong>what happened to Biel's acting career?</strong> Despite having cemented her place in Hollywood, Jessica's acting career is hardly what it was back in the '00s.</p><p>One thing is for sure though, Jessica may not be getting many acting roles, but she's certainly not hurting for cash. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The star has a reported $250 million net worth</a>. This is a combined net worth with her husband, Justin Timberlake, who is responsible for the majority of Jessica's wealth. However, thanks to the various blockbusters she starred in at the peak of her career and the product endorsements and partnerships over the years, a good chunk comes from Jessica as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/justin-timberlake-and-jessica-biel.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Did Justin Timberlake And Jessica Biel's Relationship Troubles Affect Their Son, Silas?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Justin Timberlake And Jessica Biel reportedly work hard to shield their son Silas from their relationship strife.</span><p><strong>Updated January 2024: </strong>Jessica Biel has not been in the press recently regarding her career. Instead, it has been regarding her relationship with her husband, <a href=#>Justin Timberlake since Britney Spears' memoir release</a>. While neither she nor Timberlake has addressed any relationship issues, were she and Timberlake to separate, it is unclear just how much of the fortune that Timberlake has amassed would be given to Biel, whose career has slowed over the years. However, with a project in pre-production, perhaps Biel is ready for a career comeback now that her children are a bit older.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-jessica-biel-worth>How Much Is Jessica Biel Worth?</h2><h3 id=jessica-biel-is-estimated-to-have-a-net-worth-between-20-million-and-50-million>Jessica Biel is estimated to have a net worth between $20 million and $50 million</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/instar52779072-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jessica shot to stardom after starring in the WB family drama, 7th Heaven, and became a household name in the late '90s. The star hit her peak as an actress in the mid-'00s, which undoubtedly translated to an increase in her net worth. The actress/producer is valued at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$20 million to $50 million</a>, which is pretty impressive.</p><p>During the '00s, Jessica appeared in movies like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Illusionist, and Blade: Trinity. The movies performed well at the box office, thus it's safe to assume that they helped the star amass her fortune. Jessica reportedly gets around $2 to $5 million per movie.</p><p>Other notable projects that Jessica has appeared in, according to IMDb include:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>Candy (TV Mini Series)</p></td><td><p>2022</p></td><td><p>Candy Montgomery (lead role)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Pete the Cat (TV Series)</p></td><td><p>2018-2022</p></td><td><p>Bethany Burrow (voice)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Limetown (TV Series)</p></td><td><p>2019</p></td><td><p>Lia Haddock (lead role)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>The Sinner (TV Series)</p></td><td><p>2017</p></td><td><p>Cora Tannetti (lead role)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Playing for Keeps (Movie)</p></td><td><p>2012</p></td><td><p>Stacie (lead role)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Total Recall (Movie)</p></td><td><p>2012</p></td><td><p>Melina (lead role)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>The A-Team (Movie)</p></td><td><p>2010</p></td><td><p>Charissa Sosa (lead role)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Valentine's Day (Movie)</p></td><td><p>2010</p></td><td><p>Kara Monahan (lead role)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The actress has done exceptionally well for herself, with an estimated $20 million to $50 million net worth. The rest of her net worth is thanks to her husband, Justin Timberlake.</p><p>Like his wife, Justin is a Hollywood A-lister, who started out in the famous boy band NSYNC and later pivoted to acting.
