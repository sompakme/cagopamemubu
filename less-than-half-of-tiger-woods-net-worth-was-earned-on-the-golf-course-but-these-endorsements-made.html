And, despite being the top-earning professional golfer of all time, much of his fortune has come from endorsement deals and other business ventures. These are the endorsements responsible for making Tiger Woods a billionaire.</p><h2 id=how-much-has-tiger-woods-earned-on-the-golf-course><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>How Much Has Tiger Woods Earned On The Golf Course?</span></h2><h3 id=total-earnings-in-2023-75-1-million>Total Earnings In 2023: $75.1 Million</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tiger-woods-bmw-championship.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like many other world-class athletes who have achieved G.O.A.T. status, Tiger Woods was introduced to golf at an extremely early age - before the age of two. His father, Earl Woods, was a single-digit handicap amateur golfer, and inspired Tiger to play the sport that would give him the title of the highest-earning golfer of all time.</p><p>According to Golf, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Woods remains at the pinnacle of golf's all-time earning list with a total of $120,954,766.</a> Again, this figure reflects his golf earnings only from PGA Tours, <a href=#>minus the money he has received from endorsement deals</a> and other golf tournaments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/it-cost-tiger-woods-and-elin-nordegren-s-wedding-guests-thousands-of-dollars-just-to-book-their-hotel-stay.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Tiger Woods Used His Prenup To Bribe Elin Nordegren To Stay In Their Marriage After His Affairs</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Tiger Woods attempted to save money by offering an unsavory deal to Erin Nordegren.</span><p>This is significant because Tiger Woods is the only professional golfer to have made nine figures in PGA Tour earnings. Behind him in second place is the 53-year-old golfer, Phil Mickelson, who has earned $96,572,310. Woods' net worth has been on the incline ever since he burst onto the scene in 1996, and has only seen a dramatic increase ever since. A few of the highlights of his dynamic career include 82 PGA Tour wins, 41 European Tour wins, and five Masters wins. So, the $120.9 million doesn't even include the earnings from other major professional golf tournaments he's won.</p><h2 id=how-much-does-tiger-woods-earn-from-his-nike-endorsement><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>How Much Does Tiger Woods Earn From His Nike Endorsement?</span></h2><h3 id=total-earnings-from-nike-500-million>Total Earnings From Nike: $500 Million</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/how-much-has-tiger-woods-insane-net-worth-been-changed-by-the-pga-championships_.jpg><p>Tiger Woods was such an elite golf player at the junior and amateur level that as soon as he became a professional golfer in 1996, he signed his first contract with Nike. The initial <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nike endorsement was a five-year agreement worth $40 million</a>, according to Sportskeeda. However, since then, the contract has been updated four times over the span of his career. The first update came in 2001, which more than doubled the earnings of his first contract, roughly around $100 million. Around the time, Woods was 26, and the agreement would be for another five years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The third contract update was scheduled for 2006, at which point Tiger Woods began earning $200 million from the Nike contract, this time for a ten-year agreement. Nike also proved to be Woods' most loyal endorsement company, being that they upheld their contract agreement with him despite the negative publicity about extramarital affairs he received, as well as other run-ins with the law. Over the span of their 27-year contract agreement, it's safe to say that Nike doesn't have plans to end their endorsement deal with Tiger Woods any time soon.</p><h2 id=how-much-does-tiger-woods-earn-from-his-gatorade-endorsement><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>How Much Does Tiger Woods Earn From His Gatorade Endorsement?</span></h2><h3 id=total-earnings-from-gatorade-120-9-million>Total Earnings From Gatorade: $120.9 Million</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/how-much-has-tiger-woods-insane-net-worth-been-changed-by-the-pga-championships_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another sponsorship that made Tiger Woods a fortune was the sports beverage and food products company, Gatorade. While it doesn't count as one of his long-term endorsements, lasting just two years, Woods still added significantly to his net worth for that period. According to Verdict, his sponsorship deal with Gatorade lasted between 2007 and 2009, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">earning him upward of $40 million annually.</a></p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tiger-woods-net-worth-was-partially-built-by-a-secret-investment-deal-that-fans-are-unaware-of.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Much Has Tiger Woods's Insane Net Worth Been Changed By The PGA Championships?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Tiger Woods has won more money from PGA Championships than anyone else in history.</span><p>When the company dropped him in December 2009, Tiger Woods left with $120.9 million, largely because he refused to take a one-time payment. Instead, he opted to take a cut of the profits from the sales of Gatorade Tiger Woods Thirst Quencher products, which came out in 2008. While it's unclear whether Gatorade's decision to drop him from the endorsement had anything to do <a href=#>with the affairs of his private life</a>, getting a cut of the Gatorade product sales was a genius move.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-does-tiger-woods-earn-from-his-bridgestone-endorsement><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>How Much Does Tiger Woods Earn From His Bridgestone Endorsement?</span></h2><h3 id=total-earnings-from-bridgestone-golf-15-million>Total Earnings From Bridgestone Golf: $15 Million</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/woods-friends.png><p>One of Tiger Woods' more recent brand endorsements is with the golf ball manufacturing company, Bridgestone, which was signed in 2016. The multi-year deal came about as a result of Nike unexpectedly announcing their discontinuation of golf equipment production. The move by Bridgestone was strategic, being that Woods was, and still is, the face of golf, despite being in his early forties at the time of signing the deal.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to a report from CNBC</a>, the details of the contract were not known, but it's estimated that Tiger Woods is making $1-2 million per year, which is much less than what he made in his prime.</p><h2 id=how-much-does-tiger-woods-earn-from-his-musclepharm-endorsement><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>How Much Does Tiger Woods Earn From His MusclePharm Endorsement?</span></h2><h3 id=total-earnings-from-musclepharm-9-5-million>Total Earnings From MusclePharm: $9.5 Million</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tiger-woods-medal-of-freedom.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In July 2014, the performance lifestyle and nutritional supplement brand, MusclePharm, signed a four-year contract with Tiger Woods giving them the right to have their logo plastered on his gold bag.

According to ESPN, he played a total of 15 tournaments with the company's logo advertised on his golf bag, for which he was paid $7 million. It's believed that the contract was terminated because of a need to save money. This may be true, because earlier that year, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MusclePharm also terminated their deal with Arnold Schwarzenegger,</a> which is said to have saved them $22.5 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These are some of the other companies that ended their endorsement deals with Tiger Woods, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to CBS News:</a></p><table border=1 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=6 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Sponsorship</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Duration of Contract</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Worth of Contract</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>AT&T</p></td><td><p>2009-2009</p></td><td><p>$7 million annually</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Accenture</p></td><td><p>2003-2009</p></td><td><p>$7 million annually</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Tag Heuer</p></td><td><p>2002-2009</p></td><td><p>$2 million annually</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Gillette</p></td><td><p>2007-2009</p></td><td><p>$5 million annually</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Golf Digest</p></td><td><p>1997-2010</p></td><td><p>$2 million annually</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Titleist</p></td><td><p>1996-2000</p></td><td><p>$20 million</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>General Motors</p></td><td><p>2000-2008</p></td><td><p>$7 million annually</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Buick</p></td><td><p>1999-2008</p></td><td><p>$5 million annually</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-does-tiger-woods-earn-from-his-rolex-endorsement><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>How Much Does Tiger Woods Earn From His Rolex Endorsement?</span></h2><h3 id=total-earnings-from-rolex-35-million>Total Earnings From Rolex: +$35 million</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The business relationship between Rolex and Tiger Woods seems like it was meant to be. That's because the GOAT of golfing first signed his first contract with Rolex in 1997, right after turning pro. However, he abandoned his endorsement deal with the luxury company in 2002 in favor of a deal with their rival watch company, Tag Heuer, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to GQ.</a> However, due to the <a href=#>negative publicity surrounding infidelity to his ex-wife Eilin Nordegren</a>, Tag Heuer ended their sponsorship deal with him in 2011.

Despite having nothing to do with golf, the motorcycle company signed a four-year endorsement deal with Woods in December 2014 that was reported to be paying him more than $10 million per year. When the contract was coming to an end in December 2018, the company renewed the endorsement deal for another four years.
